       "'Chapter 1.\\n\\nMr. Sherlock Holmes\\n\\n      Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings,\\n      save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all\\n      night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the\\n      hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left\\n      behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood,\\n      bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a “Penang lawyer.”\\n      Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch\\n      across. “To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the\\n      C.C.H.,” was engraved upon it, with the date “1884.” It was just\\n      such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to\\n      carry—dignified, solid, and reassuring.\\n\\n      “Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”\\n\\n      Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no\\n      sign of my occupation.\\n\\n      “How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in\\n      the back of your head.”\\n\\n      “I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in\\n      front of me,” said he. “But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of\\n      our visitor’s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss\\n      him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir\\n      becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an\\n      examination of it.”\\n\\n      “I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods of my\\n      companion, “that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical\\n      man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of\\n      their appreciation.”\\n\\n      “Good!” said Holmes. “Excellent!”\\n\\n      “I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a\\n      country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on\\n      foot.”\\n\\n      “Why so?”\\n\\n      “Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has\\n      been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town\\n      practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so\\n      it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with\\n      it.”\\n\\n      “Perfectly sound!” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should\\n      guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose\\n      members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which\\n      has made him a small presentation in return.”\\n\\n      “Really, Watson, you excel yourself,” said Holmes, pushing back\\n      his chair and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound to say that in\\n      all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own\\n      small achievements you have habitually underrated your own\\n      abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you\\n      are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius\\n      have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear\\n      fellow, that I am very much in your debt.”\\n\\n      He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words\\n      gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his\\n      indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had\\n      made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think\\n      that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way\\n      which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands\\n      and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with\\n      an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and\\n      carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a\\n      convex lens.\\n\\n      “Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned to his\\n      favourite corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two\\n      indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several\\n      deductions.”\\n\\n      “Has anything escaped me?” I asked with some self-importance. “I\\n      trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have\\n      overlooked?”\\n\\n      “I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were\\n      erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be\\n      frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided\\n      towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this\\n      instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he\\n      walks a good deal.”\\n\\n      “Then I was right.”\\n\\n      “To that extent.”\\n\\n      “But that was all.”\\n\\n      “No, no, my dear Watson, not all—by no means all. I would\\n      suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more\\n      likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when\\n      the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed before that hospital the words\\n      ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest themselves.”\\n\\n      “You may be right.”\\n\\n      “The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a\\n      working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our\\n      construction of this unknown visitor.”\\n\\n      “Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing\\n      Cross Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”\\n\\n      “Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”\\n\\n      “I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has\\n      practised in town before going to the country.”\\n\\n      “I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look\\n      at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable\\n      that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends\\n      unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the\\n      moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the\\n      hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there\\n      has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from\\n      a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching\\n      our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the\\n      occasion of the change?”\\n\\n      “It certainly seems probable.”\\n\\n      “Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the _staff_\\n      of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London\\n      practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not\\n      drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the\\n      hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a\\n      house-surgeon or a house-physician—little more than a senior\\n      student. And he left five years ago—the date is on the stick. So\\n      your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin\\n      air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under\\n      thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of\\n      a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger\\n      than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.”\\n\\n      I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his\\n      settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.\\n\\n      “As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,” said I,\\n      “but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars\\n      about the man’s age and professional career.” From my small\\n      medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the\\n      name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our\\n      visitor. I read his record aloud.\\n\\n        “Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.\\n        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.\\n        Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with\\n        essay entitled ‘Is Disease a Reversion?’  Corresponding member\\n        of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of ‘Some Freaks of\\n        Atavism’ (_Lancet_ 1882).  ‘Do We Progress?’ (_Journal of\\n        Psychology_, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of\\n        Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.”\\n\\n      “No mention of that local hunt, Watson,” said Holmes with a\\n      mischievous smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely\\n      observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As\\n      to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable,\\n      unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is\\n      only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only\\n      an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,\\n      and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his\\n      visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.”\\n\\n      “And the dog?”\\n\\n      “Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master.\\n      Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle,\\n      and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s\\n      jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in\\n      my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It\\n      may have been—yes, by Jove, it _is_ a curly-haired spaniel.”\\n\\n      He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the\\n      recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his\\n      voice that I glanced up in surprise.\\n\\n      “My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”\\n\\n      “For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our\\n      very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I\\n      beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your\\n      presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment\\n      of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is\\n      walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill.\\n      What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock\\n      Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!”\\n\\n      The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had\\n      expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin\\n      man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two\\n      keen, grey eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from\\n      behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a\\n      professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was\\n      dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was\\n      already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head\\n      and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes\\n      fell upon the stick in Holmes’s hand, and he ran towards it with\\n      an exclamation of joy. “I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not\\n      sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I\\n      would not lose that stick for the world.”\\n\\n      “A presentation, I see,” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “From Charing Cross Hospital?”\\n\\n      “From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.”\\n\\n      “Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Holmes, shaking his head.\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.\\n      “Why was it bad?”\\n\\n      “Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your\\n      marriage, you say?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all\\n      hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home\\n      of my own.”\\n\\n      “Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Holmes.\\n      “And now, Dr. James Mortimer—”\\n\\n      “Mister, sir, Mister—a humble M.R.C.S.”\\n\\n      “And a man of precise mind, evidently.”\\n\\n      “A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the\\n      shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr.\\n      Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not—”\\n\\n      “No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.”\\n\\n      “Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in\\n      connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much,\\n      Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or\\n      such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any\\n      objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A\\n      cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would\\n      be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my\\n      intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.”\\n\\n      Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are\\n      an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am\\n      in mine,” said he. “I observe from your forefinger that you make\\n      your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.”\\n\\n      The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the\\n      other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers\\n      as agile and restless as the antennæ of an insect.\\n\\n      Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the\\n      interest which he took in our curious companion. “I presume,\\n      sir,” said he at last, “that it was not merely for the purpose of\\n      examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here\\n      last night and again today?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of\\n      doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I\\n      recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am\\n      suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary\\n      problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest\\n      expert in Europe—”\\n\\n      “Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?”\\n      asked Holmes with some asperity.\\n\\n      “To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur\\n      Bertillon must always appeal strongly.”\\n\\n      “Then had you not better consult him?”\\n\\n      “I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a\\n      practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.\\n      I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently—”\\n\\n      “Just a little,” said Holmes. “I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would\\n      do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly\\n      what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my\\n      assistance.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2.\\n\\nThe Curse of the Baskervilles\\n\\n      “I have in my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer.\\n\\n      “I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “It is an old manuscript.”\\n\\n      “Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”\\n\\n      “How can you say that, sir?”\\n\\n      “You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all\\n      the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert\\n      who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.\\n      You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject.\\n      I put that at 1730.”\\n\\n      “The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Mortimer drew it from his\\n      breast-pocket. “This family paper was committed to my care by Sir\\n      Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three\\n      months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say\\n      that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant.\\n      He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as\\n      unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very\\n      seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did\\n      eventually overtake him.”\\n\\n      Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it\\n      upon his knee. “You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of\\n      the long _s_ and the short. It is one of several indications\\n      which enabled me to fix the date.”\\n\\n      I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded\\n      script. At the head was written: “Baskerville Hall,” and below in\\n      large, scrawling figures: “1742.”\\n\\n      “It appears to be a statement of some sort.”\\n\\n      “Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the\\n      Baskerville family.”\\n\\n      “But I understand that it is something more modern and practical\\n      upon which you wish to consult me?”\\n\\n      “Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be\\n      decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and\\n      is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I\\n      will read it to you.”\\n\\n      Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,\\n      and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer\\n      turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking\\n      voice the following curious, old-world narrative:\\n\\n        “Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been\\n        many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo\\n        Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also\\n        had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it\\n        occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you\\n        believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may\\n        also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy\\n        but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed.  Learn\\n        then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but\\n        rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul\\n        passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not\\n        again be loosed to our undoing.\\n\\n            “Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the\\n            history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most\\n            earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of\\n            Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be\\n            gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man.\\n             This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing\\n            that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there\\n            was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his\\n            name a by-word through the West.  It chanced that this Hugo\\n            came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known\\n            under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held\\n            lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden,\\n            being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him,\\n            for she feared his evil name.  So it came to pass that one\\n            Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and\\n            wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off\\n            the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he\\n            well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the\\n            maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his\\n            friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly\\n            custom.  Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her\\n            wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths\\n            which came up to her from below, for they say that the\\n            words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were\\n            such as might blast the man who said them.  At last in the\\n            stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted\\n            the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the\\n            growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south\\n            wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward\\n            across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall\\n            and her father’s farm.\\n\\n            “It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his\\n            guests to carry food and drink—with other worse things,\\n            perchance—to his captive, and so found the cage empty and\\n            the bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became as one\\n            that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the\\n            dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and\\n            trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all\\n            the company that he would that very night render his body\\n            and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the\\n            wench.  And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of\\n            the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than\\n            the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon\\n            her.  Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms\\n            that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and\\n            giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid’s, he swung them\\n            to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the\\n            moor.\\n\\n            “Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to\\n            understand all that had been done in such haste.  But anon\\n            their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which\\n            was like to be done upon the moorlands.  Everything was now\\n            in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for\\n            their horses, and some for another flask of wine.  But at\\n            length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the\\n            whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started\\n            in pursuit.  The moon shone clear above them, and they rode\\n            swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must\\n            needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.\\n\\n            “They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the\\n            night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him\\n            to know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as the story\\n            goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak,\\n            but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy\\n            maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  ‘But I have seen\\n            more than that,’ said he, ‘for Hugo Baskerville passed me\\n            upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a\\n            hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.’ \\n            So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward.\\n             But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a\\n            galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with\\n            white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty\\n            saddle.  Then the revellers rode close together, for a\\n            great fear was on them, but they still followed over the\\n            moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been right\\n            glad to have turned his horse’s head.  Riding slowly in\\n            this fashion they came at last upon the hounds.  These,\\n            though known for their valour and their breed, were\\n            whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal,\\n            as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some,\\n            with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the\\n            narrow valley before them.\\n\\n            “The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may\\n            guess, than when they started.  The most of them would by\\n            no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may\\n            be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal. Now, it\\n            opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great\\n            stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain\\n            forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining\\n            bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the\\n            unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of\\n            fatigue.  But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was\\n            it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her,\\n            which raised the hair upon the heads of these three\\n            dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo,\\n            and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a\\n            great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than\\n            any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.  And even\\n            as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo\\n            Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and\\n            dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and\\n            rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor.  One,\\n            it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and\\n            the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their\\n            days.\\n\\n            “Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound\\n            which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever\\n            since.  If I have set it down it is because that which is\\n            clearly known hath less terror than that which is but\\n            hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many of\\n            the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have\\n            been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we shelter\\n            ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which\\n            would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or\\n            fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ.  To\\n            that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I\\n            counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the\\n            moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are\\n            exalted.\\n\\n            “[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,\\n            with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their\\n            sister Elizabeth.]”\\n\\n      When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he\\n      pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr.\\n      Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his\\n      cigarette into the fire.\\n\\n      “Well?” said he.\\n\\n      “Do you not find it interesting?”\\n\\n      “To a collector of fairy tales.”\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.\\n\\n      “Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more\\n      recent. This is the _Devon County Chronicle_ of May 14th of this\\n      year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of\\n      Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that\\n      date.”\\n\\n      My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became\\n      intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:\\n\\n        “The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name\\n        has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for\\n        Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the\\n        county.  Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for\\n        a comparatively short period his amiability of character and\\n        extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who\\n        had been brought into contact with him.  In these days of\\n        _nouveaux riches_ it is refreshing to find a case where the\\n        scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days\\n        is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him\\n        to restore the fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is\\n        well known, made large sums of money in South African\\n        speculation. More wise than those who go on until the wheel\\n        turns against them, he realised his gains and returned to\\n        England with them.  It is only two years since he took up his\\n        residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large\\n        were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have\\n        been interrupted by his death.  Being himself childless, it was\\n        his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,\\n        within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many\\n        will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.  His\\n        generous donations to local and county charities have been\\n        frequently chronicled in these columns.\\n\\n            “The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles\\n            cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the\\n            inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of\\n            those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.\\n            There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to\\n            imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.\\n            Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to\\n            have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In\\n            spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his\\n            personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville\\n            Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the\\n            husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper. Their\\n            evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to\\n            show that Sir Charles’s health has for some time been\\n            impaired, and points especially to some affection of the\\n            heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,\\n            breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.\\n            Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the\\n            deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.\\n\\n            “The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville\\n            was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking\\n            down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The\\n            evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his\\n            custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his\\n            intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered\\n            Barrymore to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out\\n            as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he\\n            was in the habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned. \\n            At twelve o’clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still\\n            open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in\\n            search of his master.  The day had been wet, and Sir\\n            Charles’s footmarks were easily traced down the alley. \\n            Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on\\n            to the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had\\n            stood for some little time here.  He then proceeded down\\n            the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body\\n            was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is\\n            the statement of Barrymore that his master’s footprints\\n            altered their character from the time that he passed the\\n            moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have\\n            been walking upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy\\n            horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the\\n            time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the\\n            worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is\\n            unable to state from what direction they came.  No signs of\\n            violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles’s person,\\n            and though the doctor’s evidence pointed to an almost\\n            incredible facial distortion—so great that Dr. Mortimer\\n            refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend\\n            and patient who lay before him—it was explained that that\\n            is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnœa and\\n            death from cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne\\n            out by the post-mortem examination, which showed\\n            long-standing organic disease, and the coroner’s jury\\n            returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.\\n             It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the\\n            utmost importance that Sir Charles’s heir should settle at\\n            the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly\\n            interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not\\n            finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been\\n            whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been\\n            difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall.  It is\\n            understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,\\n            if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville’s\\n            younger brother.  The young man when last heard of was in\\n            America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to\\n            informing him of his good fortune.”\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket.\\n      “Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the\\n      death of Sir Charles Baskerville.”\\n\\n      “I must thank you,” said Sherlock Holmes, “for calling my\\n      attention to a case which certainly presents some features of\\n      interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but\\n      I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the\\n      Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch\\n      with several interesting English cases. This article, you say,\\n      contains all the public facts?”\\n\\n      “It does.”\\n\\n      “Then let me have the private ones.” He leaned back, put his\\n      finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial\\n      expression.\\n\\n      “In doing so,” said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of\\n      some strong emotion, “I am telling that which I have not confided\\n      to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the coroner’s\\n      inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in\\n      the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition.\\n      I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper\\n      says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to\\n      increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these\\n      reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less\\n      than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but\\n      with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.\\n\\n      “The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near\\n      each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a\\n      good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr.\\n      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist,\\n      there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir\\n      Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought\\n      us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so.\\n      He had brought back much scientific information from South\\n      Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together\\n      discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the\\n      Hottentot.\\n\\n      “Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me\\n      that Sir Charles’s nervous system was strained to the breaking\\n      point. He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly\\n      to heart—so much so that, although he would walk in his own\\n      grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at\\n      night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was\\n      honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and\\n      certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors\\n      were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence\\n      constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has\\n      asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen\\n      any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter\\n      question he put to me several times, and always with a voice\\n      which vibrated with excitement.\\n\\n      “I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some\\n      three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall\\n      door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of\\n      him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and\\n      stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. I\\n      whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something\\n      which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the\\n      drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go\\n      down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for\\n      it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the\\n      worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the\\n      evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion\\n      which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative\\n      which I read to you when first I came. I mention this small\\n      episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy\\n      which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter\\n      was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no\\n      justification.\\n\\n      “It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London.\\n      His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in\\n      which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was\\n      evidently having a serious effect upon his health. I thought that\\n      a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a\\n      new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at\\n      his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the last instant\\n      came this terrible catastrophe.\\n\\n      “On the night of Sir Charles’s death Barrymore the butler, who\\n      made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me,\\n      and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall\\n      within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all the\\n      facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the\\n      footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate\\n      where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the\\n      shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no\\n      other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and\\n      finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched\\n      until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his\\n      fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some\\n      strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn\\n      to his identity. There was certainly no physical injury of any\\n      kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the\\n      inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round\\n      the body. He did not observe any. But I did—some little distance\\n      off, but fresh and clear.”\\n\\n      “Footprints?”\\n\\n      “Footprints.”\\n\\n      “A man’s or a woman’s?”\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice\\n      sank almost to a whisper as he answered.\\n\\n      “Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3.\\n\\nThe Problem\\n\\n      I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a\\n      thrill in the doctor’s voice which showed that he was himself\\n      deeply moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in\\n      his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot\\n      from them when he was keenly interested.\\n\\n      “You saw this?”\\n\\n      “As clearly as I see you.”\\n\\n      “And you said nothing?”\\n\\n      “What was the use?”\\n\\n      “How was it that no one else saw it?”\\n\\n      “The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave\\n      them a thought. I don’t suppose I should have done so had I not\\n      known this legend.”\\n\\n      “There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?”\\n\\n      “No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.”\\n\\n      “You say it was large?”\\n\\n      “Enormous.”\\n\\n      “But it had not approached the body?”\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “What sort of night was it?’\\n\\n      “Damp and raw.”\\n\\n      “But not actually raining?”\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “What is the alley like?”\\n\\n      “There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and\\n      impenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.”\\n\\n      “Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?”\\n\\n      “Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either\\n      side.”\\n\\n      “I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a\\n      gate?”\\n\\n      “Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.”\\n\\n      “Is there any other opening?”\\n\\n      “None.”\\n\\n      “So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it\\n      from the house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?”\\n\\n      “There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.”\\n\\n      “Had Sir Charles reached this?”\\n\\n      “No; he lay about fifty yards from it.”\\n\\n      “Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer—and this is important—the marks which\\n      you saw were on the path and not on the grass?”\\n\\n      “No marks could show on the grass.”\\n\\n      “Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?”\\n\\n      “Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the\\n      moor-gate.”\\n\\n      “You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate\\n      closed?”\\n\\n      “Closed and padlocked.”\\n\\n      “How high was it?”\\n\\n      “About four feet high.”\\n\\n      “Then anyone could have got over it?”\\n\\n      “Yes.”\\n\\n      “And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?”\\n\\n      “None in particular.”\\n\\n      “Good heaven! Did no one examine?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I examined, myself.”\\n\\n      “And found nothing?”\\n\\n      “It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there\\n      for five or ten minutes.”\\n\\n      “How do you know that?”\\n\\n      “Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.”\\n\\n      “Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But\\n      the marks?”\\n\\n      “He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I\\n      could discern no others.”\\n\\n      Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an\\n      impatient gesture.\\n\\n      “If I had only been there!” he cried. “It is evidently a case of\\n      extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense\\n      opportunities to the scientific expert. That gravel page upon\\n      which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by\\n      the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants. Oh, Dr.\\n      Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have called\\n      me in! You have indeed much to answer for.”\\n\\n      “I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these\\n      facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not\\n      wishing to do so. Besides, besides—”\\n\\n      “Why do you hesitate?”\\n\\n      “There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of\\n      detectives is helpless.”\\n\\n      “You mean that the thing is supernatural?”\\n\\n      “I did not positively say so.”\\n\\n      “No, but you evidently think it.”\\n\\n      “Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears\\n      several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled\\n      order of Nature.”\\n\\n      “For example?”\\n\\n      “I find that before the terrible event occurred several people\\n      had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this\\n      Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal\\n      known to science. They all agreed that it was a huge creature,\\n      luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I have cross-examined these men,\\n      one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a\\n      moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful\\n      apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the\\n      legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the\\n      district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at\\n      night.”\\n\\n      “And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be\\n      supernatural?”\\n\\n      “I do not know what to believe.”\\n\\n      Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “I have hitherto confined my\\n      investigations to this world,” said he. “In a modest way I have\\n      combated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would,\\n      perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the\\n      footmark is material.”\\n\\n      “The original hound was material enough to tug a man’s throat\\n      out, and yet he was diabolical as well.”\\n\\n      “I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But\\n      now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why\\n      have you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same\\n      breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles’s death, and\\n      that you desire me to do it.”\\n\\n      “I did not say that I desired you to do it.”\\n\\n      “Then, how can I assist you?”\\n\\n      “By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry\\n      Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Station”—Dr. Mortimer looked\\n      at his watch—“in exactly one hour and a quarter.”\\n\\n      “He being the heir?”\\n\\n      “Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young\\n      gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the\\n      accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every\\n      way. I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and\\n      executor of Sir Charles’s will.”\\n\\n      “There is no other claimant, I presume?”\\n\\n      “None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was\\n      Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor\\n      Sir Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is\\n      the father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black\\n      sheep of the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville\\n      strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family\\n      picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold him, fled to\\n      Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is\\n      the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet\\n      him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at\\n      Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise\\n      me to do with him?”\\n\\n      “Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?”\\n\\n      “It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every\\n      Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure\\n      that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he\\n      would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old\\n      race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet\\n      it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak\\n      countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which\\n      has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is\\n      no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by\\n      my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring\\n      the case before you and ask for your advice.”\\n\\n      Holmes considered for a little time.\\n\\n      “Put into plain words, the matter is this,” said he. “In your\\n      opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an\\n      unsafe abode for a Baskerville—that is your opinion?”\\n\\n      “At least I might go the length of saying that there is some\\n      evidence that this may be so.”\\n\\n      “Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it\\n      could work the young man evil in London as easily as in\\n      Devonshire. A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry\\n      would be too inconceivable a thing.”\\n\\n      “You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would\\n      probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these\\n      things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young\\n      man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty\\n      minutes. What would you recommend?”\\n\\n      “I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who\\n      is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet\\n      Sir Henry Baskerville.”\\n\\n      “And then?”\\n\\n      “And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up\\n      my mind about the matter.”\\n\\n      “How long will it take you to make up your mind?”\\n\\n      “Twenty-four hours. At ten o’clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will\\n      be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will\\n      be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir\\n      Henry Baskerville with you.”\\n\\n      “I will do so, Mr. Holmes.” He scribbled the appointment on his\\n      shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded\\n      fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.\\n\\n      “Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir\\n      Charles Baskerville’s death several people saw this apparition\\n      upon the moor?”\\n\\n      “Three people did.”\\n\\n      “Did any see it after?”\\n\\n      “I have not heard of any.”\\n\\n      “Thank you. Good-morning.”\\n\\n      Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward\\n      satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.\\n\\n      “Going out, Watson?”\\n\\n      “Unless I can help you.”\\n\\n      “No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to\\n      you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points\\n      of view. When you pass Bradley’s, would you ask him to send up a\\n      pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as\\n      well if you could make it convenient not to return before\\n      evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to\\n      this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this\\n      morning.”\\n\\n      I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my\\n      friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during\\n      which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed\\n      alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up\\n      his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial.\\n      I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker\\n      Street until evening. It was nearly nine o’clock when I found\\n      myself in the sitting-room once more.\\n\\n      My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had\\n      broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light\\n      of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered,\\n      however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of\\n      strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me\\n      coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his\\n      dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe\\n      between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.\\n\\n      “Caught cold, Watson?” said he.\\n\\n      “No, it’s this poisonous atmosphere.”\\n\\n      “I suppose it _is_ pretty thick, now that you mention it.”\\n\\n      “Thick! It is intolerable.”\\n\\n      “Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I\\n      perceive.”\\n\\n      “My dear Holmes!”\\n\\n      “Am I right?”\\n\\n      “Certainly, but how?”\\n\\n      He laughed at my bewildered expression. “There is a delightful\\n      freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to\\n      exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense. A\\n      gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns\\n      immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his\\n      boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man\\n      with intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not\\n      obvious?”\\n\\n      “Well, it is rather obvious.”\\n\\n      “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance\\n      ever observes. Where do you think that I have been?”\\n\\n      “A fixture also.”\\n\\n      “On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.”\\n\\n      “In spirit?”\\n\\n      “Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret\\n      to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and\\n      an incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to\\n      Stamford’s for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and\\n      my spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I\\n      could find my way about.”\\n\\n      “A large-scale map, I presume?”\\n\\n      “Very large.”\\n\\n      He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. “Here you have\\n      the particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville\\n      Hall in the middle.”\\n\\n      “With a wood round it?”\\n\\n      “Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that\\n      name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you\\n      perceive, upon the right of it. This small clump of buildings\\n      here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has\\n      his headquarters. Within a radius of five miles there are, as you\\n      see, only a very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall,\\n      which was mentioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated\\n      here which may be the residence of the naturalist—Stapleton, if I\\n      remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farmhouses,\\n      High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the great convict\\n      prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered points\\n      extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage\\n      upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to\\n      play it again.”\\n\\n      “It must be a wild place.”\\n\\n      “Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to\\n      have a hand in the affairs of men—”\\n\\n      “Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural\\n      explanation.”\\n\\n      “The devil’s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?\\n      There are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is\\n      whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what\\n      is the crime and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr.\\n      Mortimer’s surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with\\n      forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of\\n      our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all other\\n      hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we’ll shut\\n      that window again, if you don’t mind. It is a singular thing, but\\n      I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of\\n      thought. I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box\\n      to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions. Have\\n      you turned the case over in your mind?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.”\\n\\n      “What do you make of it?”\\n\\n      “It is very bewildering.”\\n\\n      “It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of\\n      distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.\\n      What do you make of that?”\\n\\n      “Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that\\n      portion of the alley.”\\n\\n      “He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why\\n      should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?”\\n\\n      “What then?”\\n\\n      “He was running, Watson—running desperately, running for his\\n      life, running until he burst his heart—and fell dead upon his\\n      face.”\\n\\n      “Running from what?”\\n\\n      “There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was\\n      crazed with fear before ever he began to run.”\\n\\n      “How can you say that?”\\n\\n      “I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across\\n      the moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man\\n      who had lost his wits would have run _from_ the house instead of\\n      towards it. If the gipsy’s evidence may be taken as true, he ran\\n      with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely\\n      to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why\\n      was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own\\n      house?”\\n\\n      “You think that he was waiting for someone?”\\n\\n      “The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an\\n      evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement.\\n      Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as\\n      Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given\\n      him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?”\\n\\n      “But he went out every evening.”\\n\\n      “I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every\\n      evening. On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the\\n      moor. That night he waited there. It was the night before he made\\n      his departure for London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It\\n      becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we\\n      will postpone all further thought upon this business until we\\n      have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry\\n      Baskerville in the morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4.\\n\\nSir Henry Baskerville\\n\\n      Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his\\n      dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were\\n      punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten\\n      when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet.\\n      The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years\\n      of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a\\n      strong, pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and\\n      had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of\\n      his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his\\n      steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated\\n      the gentleman.\\n\\n      “This is Sir Henry Baskerville,” said Dr. Mortimer.\\n\\n      “Why, yes,” said he, “and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock\\n      Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to\\n      you this morning I should have come on my own account. I\\n      understand that you think out little puzzles, and I’ve had one\\n      this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give\\n      it.”\\n\\n      “Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you\\n      have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in\\n      London?”\\n\\n      “Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as\\n      not. It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which\\n      reached me this morning.”\\n\\n      He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It\\n      was of common quality, greyish in colour. The address, “Sir Henry\\n      Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel,” was printed in rough\\n      characters; the post-mark “Charing Cross,” and the date of\\n      posting the preceding evening.\\n\\n      “Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?” asked\\n      Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.\\n\\n      “No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr.\\n      Mortimer.”\\n\\n      “But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?”\\n\\n      “No, I had been staying with a friend,” said the doctor.\\n\\n      “There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this\\n      hotel.”\\n\\n      “Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your\\n      movements.” Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap\\n      paper folded into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the\\n      table. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed\\n      by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. It ran:\\n\\n        As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.\\n\\n      The word “moor” only was printed in ink.\\n\\n      “Now,” said Sir Henry Baskerville, “perhaps you will tell me, Mr.\\n      Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is\\n      that takes so much interest in my affairs?”\\n\\n      “What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there\\n      is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was\\n      convinced that the business is supernatural.”\\n\\n      “What business?” asked Sir Henry sharply. “It seems to me that\\n      all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own\\n      affairs.”\\n\\n      “You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir\\n      Henry. I promise you that,” said Sherlock Holmes. “We will\\n      confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this\\n      very interesting document, which must have been put together and\\n      posted yesterday evening. Have you yesterday’s _Times_, Watson?”\\n\\n      “It is here in the corner.”\\n\\n      “Might I trouble you for it—the inside page, please, with the\\n      leading articles?” He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes\\n      up and down the columns. “Capital article this on free trade.\\n      Permit me to give you an extract from it.\\n\\n     ‘You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or\\n     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but\\n     it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run\\n     keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our\\n     imports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island.’\\n\\n      “What do you think of that, Watson?” cried Holmes in high glee,\\n      rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. “Don’t you think\\n      that is an admirable sentiment?”\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional\\n      interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark\\n      eyes upon me.\\n\\n      “I don’t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,”\\n      said he, “but it seems to me we’ve got a bit off the trail so far\\n      as that note is concerned.”\\n\\n      “On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail,\\n      Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do,\\n      but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of\\n      this sentence.”\\n\\n      “No, I confess that I see no connection.”\\n\\n      “And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection\\n      that the one is extracted out of the other. ‘You,’ ‘your,’\\n      ‘your,’ ‘life,’ ‘reason,’ ‘value,’ ‘keep away,’ ‘from the.’ Don’t\\n      you see now whence these words have been taken?”\\n\\n      “By thunder, you’re right! Well, if that isn’t smart!” cried Sir\\n      Henry.\\n\\n      “If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that\\n      ‘keep away’ and ‘from the’ are cut out in one piece.”\\n\\n      “Well, now—so it is!”\\n\\n      “Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have\\n      imagined,” said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement.\\n      “I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a\\n      newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came\\n      from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable\\n      things which I have ever known. How did you do it?”\\n\\n      “I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from\\n      that of an Esquimau?”\\n\\n      “Most certainly.”\\n\\n      “But how?”\\n\\n      “Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious.\\n      The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve,\\n      the—”\\n\\n      “But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally\\n      obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the\\n      leaded bourgeois type of a _Times_ article and the slovenly print\\n      of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your\\n      negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the\\n      most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in\\n      crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I\\n      confused the _Leeds Mercury_ with the _Western Morning News_. But\\n      a _Times_ leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could\\n      have been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the\\n      strong probability was that we should find the words in\\n      yesterday’s issue.”\\n\\n      “So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,” said Sir Henry\\n      Baskerville, “someone cut out this message with a scissors—”\\n\\n      “Nail-scissors,” said Holmes. “You can see that it was a very\\n      short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips\\n      over ‘keep away.’”\\n\\n      “That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of\\n      short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste—”\\n\\n      “Gum,” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word ‘moor’\\n      should have been written?”\\n\\n      “Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all\\n      simple and might be found in any issue, but ‘moor’ would be less\\n      common.”\\n\\n      “Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything\\n      else in this message, Mr. Holmes?”\\n\\n      “There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have\\n      been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is\\n      printed in rough characters. But the _Times_ is a paper which is\\n      seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We\\n      may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an\\n      educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his\\n      effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing\\n      might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will\\n      observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but\\n      that some are much higher than others. ‘Life,’ for example is\\n      quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or\\n      it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.\\n      On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was\\n      evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such\\n      a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the\\n      interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any\\n      letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he\\n      would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption—and\\n      from whom?”\\n\\n      “We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,” said Dr.\\n      Mortimer.\\n\\n      “Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and\\n      choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the\\n      imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to\\n      start our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt,\\n      but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a\\n      hotel.”\\n\\n      “How in the world can you say that?”\\n\\n      “If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and\\n      the ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered\\n      twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short\\n      address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle.\\n      Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such\\n      a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. But\\n      you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get\\n      anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that\\n      could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around\\n      Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated _Times_\\n      leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent\\n      this singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What’s this?”\\n\\n      He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words\\n      were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.\\n\\n      “Well?”\\n\\n      “Nothing,” said he, throwing it down. “It is a blank half-sheet\\n      of paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have\\n      drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir\\n      Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you\\n      have been in London?”\\n\\n      “Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.”\\n\\n      “You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?”\\n\\n      “I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,”\\n      said our visitor. “Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch\\n      me?”\\n\\n      “We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us\\n      before we go into this matter?”\\n\\n      “Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.”\\n\\n      “I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth\\n      reporting.”\\n\\n      Sir Henry smiled. “I don’t know much of British life yet, for I\\n      have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I\\n      hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary\\n      routine of life over here.”\\n\\n      “You have lost one of your boots?”\\n\\n      “My dear sir,” cried Dr. Mortimer, “it is only mislaid. You will\\n      find it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of\\n      troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?”\\n\\n      “Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.”\\n\\n      “Exactly,” said Holmes, “however foolish the incident may seem.\\n      You have lost one of your boots, you say?”\\n\\n      “Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last\\n      night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no\\n      sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I\\n      only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never\\n      had them on.”\\n\\n      “If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be\\n      cleaned?”\\n\\n      “They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I\\n      put them out.”\\n\\n      “Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you\\n      went out at once and bought a pair of boots?”\\n\\n      “I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with\\n      me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the\\n      part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways\\n      out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots—gave six\\n      dollars for them—and had one stolen before ever I had them on my\\n      feet.”\\n\\n      “It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,” said Sherlock\\n      Holmes. “I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer’s belief that it\\n      will not be long before the missing boot is found.”\\n\\n      “And, now, gentlemen,” said the baronet with decision, “it seems\\n      to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I\\n      know. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full\\n      account of what we are all driving at.”\\n\\n      “Your request is a very reasonable one,” Holmes answered. “Dr.\\n      Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story\\n      as you told it to us.”\\n\\n      Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his\\n      pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the\\n      morning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest\\n      attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.\\n\\n      “Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,”\\n      said he when the long narrative was finished. “Of course, I’ve\\n      heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. It’s the pet\\n      story of the family, though I never thought of taking it\\n      seriously before. But as to my uncle’s death—well, it all seems\\n      boiling up in my head, and I can’t get it clear yet. You don’t\\n      seem quite to have made up your mind whether it’s a case for a\\n      policeman or a clergyman.”\\n\\n      “Precisely.”\\n\\n      “And now there’s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I\\n      suppose that fits into its place.”\\n\\n      “It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what\\n      goes on upon the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer.\\n\\n      “And also,” said Holmes, “that someone is not ill-disposed\\n      towards you, since they warn you of danger.”\\n\\n      “Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me\\n      away.”\\n\\n      “Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted\\n      to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which\\n      presents several interesting alternatives. But the practical\\n      point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or\\n      is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.”\\n\\n      “Why should I not go?”\\n\\n      “There seems to be danger.”\\n\\n      “Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger\\n      from human beings?”\\n\\n      “Well, that is what we have to find out.”\\n\\n      “Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell,\\n      Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me\\n      from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to\\n      be my final answer.” His dark brows knitted and his face flushed\\n      to a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper\\n      of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last\\n      representative. “Meanwhile,” said he, “I have hardly had time to\\n      think over all that you have told me. It’s a big thing for a man\\n      to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like\\n      to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look\\n      here, Mr. Holmes, it’s half-past eleven now and I am going back\\n      right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson,\\n      come round and lunch with us at two. I’ll be able to tell you\\n      more clearly then how this thing strikes me.”\\n\\n      “Is that convenient to you, Watson?”\\n\\n      “Perfectly.”\\n\\n      “Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?”\\n\\n      “I’d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.”\\n\\n      “I’ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,” said his companion.\\n\\n      “Then we meet again at two o’clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!”\\n\\n      We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang\\n      of the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the\\n      languid dreamer to the man of action.\\n\\n      “Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!” He\\n      rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a\\n      few seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs\\n      and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still\\n      visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of\\n      Oxford Street.\\n\\n      “Shall I run on and stop them?”\\n\\n      “Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with\\n      your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for\\n      it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.”\\n\\n      He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which\\n      divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards\\n      behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street.\\n      Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon\\n      which Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little\\n      cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager\\n      eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted\\n      on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward\\n      again.\\n\\n      “There’s our man, Watson! Come along! We’ll have a good look at\\n      him, if we can do no more.”\\n\\n      At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of\\n      piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.\\n      Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed\\n      to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street.\\n      Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in\\n      sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the\\n      traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out\\n      of sight.\\n\\n      “There now!” said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white\\n      with vexation from the tide of vehicles. “Was ever such bad luck\\n      and such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an\\n      honest man you will record this also and set it against my\\n      successes!”\\n\\n      “Who was the man?”\\n\\n      “I have not an idea.”\\n\\n      “A spy?”\\n\\n      “Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville\\n      has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in\\n      town. How else could it be known so quickly that it was the\\n      Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had followed\\n      him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the\\n      second. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the\\n      window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.”\\n\\n      “Yes, I remember.”\\n\\n      “I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none.\\n      We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very\\n      deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is\\n      a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I\\n      am conscious always of power and design. When our friends left I\\n      at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their\\n      invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted\\n      himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he\\n      could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.\\n      His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take\\n      a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one\\n      obvious disadvantage.”\\n\\n      “It puts him in the power of the cabman.”\\n\\n      “Exactly.”\\n\\n      “What a pity we did not get the number!”\\n\\n      “My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not\\n      seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is\\n      our man. But that is no use to us for the moment.”\\n\\n      “I fail to see how you could have done more.”\\n\\n      “On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked\\n      in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a\\n      second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or,\\n      better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited\\n      there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should\\n      have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and\\n      seeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness,\\n      which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and\\n      energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our\\n      man.”\\n\\n      We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this\\n      conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long\\n      vanished in front of us.\\n\\n      “There is no object in our following them,” said Holmes. “The\\n      shadow has departed and will not return. We must see what further\\n      cards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you\\n      swear to that man’s face within the cab?”\\n\\n      “I could swear only to the beard.”\\n\\n      “And so could I—from which I gather that in all probability it\\n      was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no\\n      use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here,\\n      Watson!”\\n\\n      He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he\\n      was warmly greeted by the manager.\\n\\n      “Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in\\n      which I had the good fortune to help you?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps\\n      my life.”\\n\\n      “My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection,\\n      Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who\\n      showed some ability during the investigation.”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, he is still with us.”\\n\\n      “Could you ring him up?—thank you! And I should be glad to have\\n      change of this five-pound note.”\\n\\n      A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the\\n      summons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence\\n      at the famous detective.\\n\\n      “Let me have the Hotel Directory,” said Holmes. “Thank you! Now,\\n      Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all\\n      in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “You will visit each of these in turn.”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one\\n      shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings.”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of\\n      yesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscarried\\n      and that you are looking for it. You understand?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the\\n      _Times_ with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy\\n      of the _Times_. It is this page. You could easily recognize it,\\n      could you not?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter,\\n      to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three\\n      shillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of\\n      the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned\\n      or removed. In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of\\n      paper and you will look for this page of the _Times_ among it.\\n      The odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten\\n      shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by\\n      wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only\\n      remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman,\\n      No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street\\n      picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the\\n      hotel.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5.\\n\\nThree Broken Threads\\n\\n      Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of\\n      detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in\\n      which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was\\n      entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters.\\n      He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest\\n      ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at\\n      the Northumberland Hotel.\\n\\n      “Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,” said the\\n      clerk. “He asked me to show you up at once when you came.”\\n\\n      “Have you any objection to my looking at your register?” said\\n      Holmes.\\n\\n      “Not in the least.”\\n\\n      The book showed that two names had been added after that of\\n      Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle;\\n      the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.\\n\\n      “Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,” said\\n      Holmes to the porter. “A lawyer, is he not, grey-headed, and\\n      walks with a limp?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active\\n      gentleman, not older than yourself.”\\n\\n      “Surely you are mistaken about his trade?”\\n\\n      “No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very\\n      well known to us.”\\n\\n      “Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the\\n      name. Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend\\n      one finds another.”\\n\\n      “She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of\\n      Gloucester. She always comes to us when she is in town.”\\n\\n      “Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have\\n      established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,” he\\n      continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. “We know\\n      now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not\\n      settled down in his own hotel. That means that while they are, as\\n      we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious\\n      that he should not see them. Now, this is a most suggestive\\n      fact.”\\n\\n      “What does it suggest?”\\n\\n      “It suggests—halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the\\n      matter?”\\n\\n      As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir\\n      Henry Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and\\n      he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was\\n      he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in\\n      a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had\\n      heard from him in the morning.\\n\\n      “Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,” he\\n      cried. “They’ll find they’ve started in to monkey with the wrong\\n      man unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can’t find\\n      my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the\\n      best, Mr. Holmes, but they’ve got a bit over the mark this time.”\\n\\n      “Still looking for your boot?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, and mean to find it.”\\n\\n      “But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?”\\n\\n      “So it was, sir. And now it’s an old black one.”\\n\\n      “What! you don’t mean to say—?”\\n\\n      “That’s just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the\\n      world—the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers,\\n      which I am wearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones,\\n      and today they have sneaked one of the black. Well, have you got\\n      it? Speak out, man, and don’t stand staring!”\\n\\n      An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.\\n\\n      “No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear\\n      no word of it.”\\n\\n      “Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I’ll see the\\n      manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.”\\n\\n      “It shall be found, sir—I promise you that if you will have a\\n      little patience it will be found.”\\n\\n      “Mind it is, for it’s the last thing of mine that I’ll lose in\\n      this den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you’ll excuse my\\n      troubling you about such a trifle—”\\n\\n      “I think it’s well worth troubling about.”\\n\\n      “Why, you look very serious over it.”\\n\\n      “How do you explain it?”\\n\\n      “I just don’t attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest,\\n      queerest thing that ever happened to me.”\\n\\n      “The queerest perhaps—” said Holmes thoughtfully.\\n\\n      “What do you make of it yourself?”\\n\\n      “Well, I don’t profess to understand it yet. This case of yours\\n      is very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your\\n      uncle’s death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of\\n      capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts\\n      so deep. But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds\\n      are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. We may\\n      waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we\\n      must come upon the right.”\\n\\n      We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the\\n      business which had brought us together. It was in the private\\n      sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked\\n      Baskerville what were his intentions.\\n\\n      “To go to Baskerville Hall.”\\n\\n      “And when?”\\n\\n      “At the end of the week.”\\n\\n      “On the whole,” said Holmes, “I think that your decision is a\\n      wise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in\\n      London, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult\\n      to discover who these people are or what their object can be. If\\n      their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we\\n      should be powerless to prevent it. You did not know, Dr.\\n      Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?”\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer started violently. “Followed! By whom?”\\n\\n      “That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among\\n      your neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a\\n      black, full beard?”\\n\\n      “No—or, let me see—why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles’s butler, is\\n      a man with a full, black beard.”\\n\\n      “Ha! Where is Barrymore?”\\n\\n      “He is in charge of the Hall.”\\n\\n      “We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any\\n      possibility he might be in London.”\\n\\n      “How can you do that?”\\n\\n      “Give me a telegraph form. ‘Is all ready for Sir Henry?’ That\\n      will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the\\n      nearest telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a\\n      second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: ‘Telegram to Mr.\\n      Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, please\\n      return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.’ That\\n      should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his\\n      post in Devonshire or not.”\\n\\n      “That’s so,” said Baskerville. “By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is\\n      this Barrymore, anyhow?”\\n\\n      “He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have\\n      looked after the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know,\\n      he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the\\n      county.”\\n\\n      “At the same time,” said Baskerville, “it’s clear enough that so\\n      long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people\\n      have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.”\\n\\n      “That is true.”\\n\\n      “Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles’s will?” asked\\n      Holmes.\\n\\n      “He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.”\\n\\n      “Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?”\\n\\n      “Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions\\n      of his will.”\\n\\n      “That is very interesting.”\\n\\n      “I hope,” said Dr. Mortimer, “that you do not look with\\n      suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir\\n      Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me.”\\n\\n      “Indeed! And anyone else?”\\n\\n      “There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large\\n      number of public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.”\\n\\n      “And how much was the residue?”\\n\\n      “Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.”\\n\\n      Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. “I had no idea that so\\n      gigantic a sum was involved,” said he.\\n\\n      “Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not\\n      know how very rich he was until we came to examine his\\n      securities. The total value of the estate was close on to a\\n      million.”\\n\\n      “Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a\\n      desperate game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing\\n      that anything happened to our young friend here—you will forgive\\n      the unpleasant hypothesis!—who would inherit the estate?”\\n\\n      “Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles’s younger brother died\\n      unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are\\n      distant cousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in\\n      Westmoreland.”\\n\\n      “Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met\\n      Mr. James Desmond?”\\n\\n      “Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of\\n      venerable appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he\\n      refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he\\n      pressed it upon him.”\\n\\n      “And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles’s\\n      thousands.”\\n\\n      “He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He\\n      would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed\\n      otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he\\n      likes with it.”\\n\\n      “And have you made your will, Sir Henry?”\\n\\n      “No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I’ve had no time, for it was only\\n      yesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I\\n      feel that the money should go with the title and estate. That was\\n      my poor uncle’s idea. How is the owner going to restore the\\n      glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up\\n      the property? House, land, and dollars must go together.”\\n\\n      “Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the\\n      advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay.\\n      There is only one provision which I must make. You certainly must\\n      not go alone.”\\n\\n      “Dr. Mortimer returns with me.”\\n\\n      “But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is\\n      miles away from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he may\\n      be unable to help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you\\n      someone, a trusty man, who will be always by your side.”\\n\\n      “Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?”\\n\\n      “If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in\\n      person; but you can understand that, with my extensive consulting\\n      practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many\\n      quarters, it is impossible for me to be absent from London for an\\n      indefinite time. At the present instant one of the most revered\\n      names in England is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I\\n      can stop a disastrous scandal. You will see how impossible it is\\n      for me to go to Dartmoor.”\\n\\n      “Whom would you recommend, then?”\\n\\n      Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. “If my friend would undertake\\n      it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when\\n      you are in a tight place. No one can say so more confidently than\\n      I.”\\n\\n      The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had\\n      time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it\\n      heartily.\\n\\n      “Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,” said he. “You\\n      see how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter\\n      as I do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me\\n      through I’ll never forget it.”\\n\\n      The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I\\n      was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with\\n      which the baronet hailed me as a companion.\\n\\n      “I will come, with pleasure,” said I. “I do not know how I could\\n      employ my time better.”\\n\\n      “And you will report very carefully to me,” said Holmes. “When a\\n      crisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I\\n      suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?”\\n\\n      “Would that suit Dr. Watson?”\\n\\n      “Perfectly.”\\n\\n      “Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet\\n      at the ten-thirty train from Paddington.”\\n\\n      We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry of triumph,\\n      and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown\\n      boot from under a cabinet.\\n\\n      “My missing boot!” he cried.\\n\\n      “May all our difficulties vanish as easily!” said Sherlock\\n      Holmes.\\n\\n      “But it is a very singular thing,” Dr. Mortimer remarked. “I\\n      searched this room carefully before lunch.”\\n\\n      “And so did I,” said Baskerville. “Every inch of it.”\\n\\n      “There was certainly no boot in it then.”\\n\\n      “In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were\\n      lunching.”\\n\\n      The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the\\n      matter, nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been\\n      added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small\\n      mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting\\n      aside the whole grim story of Sir Charles’s death, we had a line\\n      of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days,\\n      which included the receipt of the printed letter, the\\n      black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot,\\n      the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new\\n      brown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to\\n      Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that\\n      his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some\\n      scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected\\n      episodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late into the evening\\n      he sat lost in tobacco and thought.\\n\\n      Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:\\n\\n      Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.\\n\\n      The second:\\n\\n      Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry to report\\n      unable to trace cut sheet of _Times_. CARTWRIGHT.\\n\\n      “There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more\\n      stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. We\\n      must cast round for another scent.”\\n\\n      “We have still the cabman who drove the spy.”\\n\\n      “Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the\\n      Official Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an\\n      answer to my question.”\\n\\n      The ring at the bell proved to be something even more\\n      satisfactory than an answer, however, for the door opened and a\\n      rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself.\\n\\n      “I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address\\n      had been inquiring for No. 2704,” said he. “I’ve driven my cab\\n      this seven years and never a word of complaint. I came here\\n      straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had\\n      against me.”\\n\\n      “I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,” said\\n      Holmes. “On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you\\n      will give me a clear answer to my questions.”\\n\\n      “Well, I’ve had a good day and no mistake,” said the cabman with\\n      a grin. “What was it you wanted to ask, sir?”\\n\\n      “First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.”\\n\\n      “John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of\\n      Shipley’s Yard, near Waterloo Station.”\\n\\n      Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.\\n\\n      “Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched\\n      this house at ten o’clock this morning and afterwards followed\\n      the two gentlemen down Regent Street.”\\n\\n      The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. “Why, there’s\\n      no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I\\n      do already,” said he. “The truth is that the gentleman told me\\n      that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about him\\n      to anyone.”\\n\\n      “My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may\\n      find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide\\n      anything from me. You say that your fare told you that he was a\\n      detective?”\\n\\n      “Yes, he did.”\\n\\n      “When did he say this?”\\n\\n      “When he left me.”\\n\\n      “Did he say anything more?”\\n\\n      “He mentioned his name.”\\n\\n      Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. “Oh, he mentioned\\n      his name, did he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he\\n      mentioned?”\\n\\n      “His name,” said the cabman, “was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”\\n\\n      Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by\\n      the cabman’s reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement.\\n      Then he burst into a hearty laugh.\\n\\n      “A touch, Watson—an undeniable touch!” said he. “I feel a foil as\\n      quick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily\\n      that time. So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, that was the gentleman’s name.”\\n\\n      “Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that\\n      occurred.”\\n\\n      “He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that\\n      he was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do\\n      exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad\\n      enough to agree. First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel\\n      and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from\\n      the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near\\n      here.”\\n\\n      “This very door,” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “Well, I couldn’t be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew\\n      all about it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an\\n      hour and a half. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and\\n      we followed down Baker Street and along—”\\n\\n      “I know,” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my\\n      gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive\\n      right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped\\n      up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes. Then he paid\\n      up his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into the\\n      station. Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said:\\n      ‘It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr.\\n      Sherlock Holmes.’ That’s how I come to know the name.”\\n\\n      “I see. And you saw no more of him?”\\n\\n      “Not after he went into the station.”\\n\\n      “And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”\\n\\n      The cabman scratched his head. “Well, he wasn’t altogether such\\n      an easy gentleman to describe. I’d put him at forty years of age,\\n      and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than\\n      you, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard,\\n      cut square at the end, and a pale face. I don’t know as I could\\n      say more than that.”\\n\\n      “Colour of his eyes?”\\n\\n      “No, I can’t say that.”\\n\\n      “Nothing more that you can remember?”\\n\\n      “No, sir; nothing.”\\n\\n      “Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There’s another one\\n      waiting for you if you can bring any more information.\\n      Good-night!”\\n\\n      “Good-night, sir, and thank you!”\\n\\n      John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a\\n      shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile.\\n\\n      “Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,” said he.\\n      “The cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry\\n      Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,\\n      conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my\\n      hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. I\\n      tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of\\n      our steel. I’ve been checkmated in London. I can only wish you\\n      better luck in Devonshire. But I’m not easy in my mind about it.”\\n\\n      “About what?”\\n\\n      “About sending you. It’s an ugly business, Watson, an ugly\\n      dangerous business, and the more I see of it the less I like it.\\n      Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I\\n      shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker\\n      Street once more.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6.\\n\\nBaskerville Hall\\n\\n      Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the\\n      appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr.\\n      Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last\\n      parting injunctions and advice.\\n\\n      “I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,\\n      Watson,” said he; “I wish you simply to report facts in the\\n      fullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the\\n      theorizing.”\\n\\n      “What sort of facts?” I asked.\\n\\n      “Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon\\n      the case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville\\n      and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death\\n      of Sir Charles. I have made some inquiries myself in the last few\\n      days, but the results have, I fear, been negative. One thing only\\n      appears to be certain, and that is that Mr. James Desmond, who is\\n      the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable\\n      disposition, so that this persecution does not arise from him. I\\n      really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our\\n      calculations. There remain the people who will actually surround\\n      Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.”\\n\\n      “Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this\\n      Barrymore couple?”\\n\\n      “By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are\\n      innocent it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we\\n      should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. No,\\n      no, we will preserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there\\n      is a groom at the Hall, if I remember right. There are two\\n      moorland farmers. There is our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I\\n      believe to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we\\n      know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton, and there is\\n      his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions. There\\n      is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,\\n      and there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who\\n      must be your very special study.”\\n\\n      “I will do my best.”\\n\\n      “You have arms, I suppose?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I thought it as well to take them.”\\n\\n      “Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and\\n      never relax your precautions.”\\n\\n      Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were\\n      waiting for us upon the platform.\\n\\n      “No, we have no news of any kind,” said Dr. Mortimer in answer to\\n      my friend’s questions. “I can swear to one thing, and that is\\n      that we have not been shadowed during the last two days. We have\\n      never gone out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could\\n      have escaped our notice.”\\n\\n      “You have always kept together, I presume?”\\n\\n      “Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pure\\n      amusement when I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the\\n      College of Surgeons.”\\n\\n      “And I went to look at the folk in the park,” said Baskerville.\\n\\n      “But we had no trouble of any kind.”\\n\\n      “It was imprudent, all the same,” said Holmes, shaking his head\\n      and looking very grave. “I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go\\n      about alone. Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did\\n      you get your other boot?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, it is gone forever.”\\n\\n      “Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,” he added as\\n      the train began to glide down the platform. “Bear in mind, Sir\\n      Henry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr.\\n      Mortimer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those hours of\\n      darkness when the powers of evil are exalted.”\\n\\n      I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and\\n      saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and\\n      gazing after us.\\n\\n      The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in\\n      making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in\\n      playing with Dr. Mortimer’s spaniel. In a very few hours the\\n      brown earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite,\\n      and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields where the lush grasses\\n      and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer, if a damper,\\n      climate. Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and\\n      cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features\\n      of the Devon scenery.\\n\\n      “I’ve been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr.\\n      Watson,” said he; “but I have never seen a place to compare with\\n      it.”\\n\\n      “I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county,” I\\n      remarked.\\n\\n      “It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the\\n      county,” said Dr. Mortimer. “A glance at our friend here reveals\\n      the rounded head of the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic\\n      enthusiasm and power of attachment. Poor Sir Charles’s head was\\n      of a very rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in its\\n      characteristics. But you were very young when you last saw\\n      Baskerville Hall, were you not?”\\n\\n      “I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father’s death and had\\n      never seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the\\n      South Coast. Thence I went straight to a friend in America. I\\n      tell you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I’m\\n      as keen as possible to see the moor.”\\n\\n      “Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your\\n      first sight of the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the\\n      carriage window.\\n\\n      Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood\\n      there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a\\n      strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some\\n      fantastic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long time,\\n      his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much\\n      it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the\\n      men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so\\n      deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American accent,\\n      in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I looked\\n      at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a\\n      descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and\\n      masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his\\n      thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If\\n      on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should\\n      lie before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one might\\n      venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely\\n      share it.\\n\\n      The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all\\n      descended. Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with\\n      a pair of cobs was waiting. Our coming was evidently a great\\n      event, for station-master and porters clustered round us to carry\\n      out our luggage. It was a sweet, simple country spot, but I was\\n      surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly\\n      men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and\\n      glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a hard-faced,\\n      gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a\\n      few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road.\\n      Rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old\\n      gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but\\n      behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark\\n      against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor,\\n      broken by the jagged and sinister hills.\\n\\n      The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward\\n      through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on\\n      either side, heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart’s-tongue\\n      ferns. Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light\\n      of the sinking sun. Still steadily rising, we passed over a\\n      narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed\\n      swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the grey boulders. Both\\n      road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak\\n      and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of\\n      delight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless\\n      questions. To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of\\n      melancholy lay upon the countryside, which bore so clearly the\\n      mark of the waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and\\n      fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our wheels\\n      died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation—sad\\n      gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the\\n      carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.\\n\\n      “Halloa!” cried Dr. Mortimer, “what is this?”\\n\\n      A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor,\\n      lay in front of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an\\n      equestrian statue upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark\\n      and stern, his rifle poised ready over his forearm. He was\\n      watching the road along which we travelled.\\n\\n      “What is this, Perkins?” asked Dr. Mortimer.\\n\\n      Our driver half turned in his seat. “There’s a convict escaped\\n      from Princetown, sir. He’s been out three days now, and the\\n      warders watch every road and every station, but they’ve had no\\n      sight of him yet. The farmers about here don’t like it, sir, and\\n      that’s a fact.”\\n\\n      “Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give\\n      information.”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing\\n      compared to the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it\\n      isn’t like any ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick\\n      at nothing.”\\n\\n      “Who is he, then?”\\n\\n      “It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.”\\n\\n      I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had\\n      taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the\\n      crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions\\n      of the assassin. The commutation of his death sentence had been\\n      due to some doubts as to his complete sanity, so atrocious was\\n      his conduct. Our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us\\n      rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with gnarled and\\n      craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from it and set us\\n      shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking\\n      this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his\\n      heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast\\n      him out. It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness\\n      of the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky.\\n      Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely\\n      around him.\\n\\n      We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked\\n      back on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the\\n      streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new\\n      turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands. The\\n      road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and\\n      olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now and then we\\n      passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with no\\n      creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into\\n      a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which\\n      had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two\\n      high, narrow towers rose over the trees. The driver pointed with\\n      his whip.\\n\\n      “Baskerville Hall,” said he.\\n\\n      Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and\\n      shining eyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates,\\n      a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten\\n      pillars on either side, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by\\n      the boars’ heads of the Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of\\n      black granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a new\\n      building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles’s\\n      South African gold.\\n\\n      Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels\\n      were again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their\\n      branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered\\n      as he looked up the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered\\n      like a ghost at the farther end.\\n\\n      “Was it here?” he asked in a low voice.\\n\\n      “No, no, the yew alley is on the other side.”\\n\\n      The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.\\n\\n      “It’s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in\\n      such a place as this,” said he. “It’s enough to scare any man.\\n      I’ll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months,\\n      and you won’t know it again, with a thousand candle-power Swan\\n      and Edison right here in front of the hall door.”\\n\\n      The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay\\n      before us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a\\n      heavy block of building from which a porch projected. The whole\\n      front was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there\\n      where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil.\\n      From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient,\\n      crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To right and left of\\n      the turrets were more modern wings of black granite. A dull light\\n      shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys\\n      which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single\\n      black column of smoke.\\n\\n      “Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!”\\n\\n      A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the\\n      door of the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted\\n      against the yellow light of the hall. She came out and helped the\\n      man to hand down our bags.\\n\\n      “You don’t mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?” said Dr.\\n      Mortimer. “My wife is expecting me.”\\n\\n      “Surely you will stay and have some dinner?”\\n\\n      “No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I\\n      would stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a\\n      better guide than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to\\n      send for me if I can be of service.”\\n\\n      The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned\\n      into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a\\n      fine apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and\\n      heavily raftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In the\\n      great old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a\\n      log-fire crackled and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands\\n      to it, for we were numb from our long drive. Then we gazed round\\n      us at the high, thin window of old stained glass, the oak\\n      panelling, the stags’ heads, the coats of arms upon the walls,\\n      all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp.\\n\\n      “It’s just as I imagined it,” said Sir Henry. “Is it not the very\\n      picture of an old family home? To think that this should be the\\n      same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived.\\n      It strikes me solemn to think of it.”\\n\\n      I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed\\n      about him. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long\\n      shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above\\n      him. Barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms.\\n      He stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a\\n      well-trained servant. He was a remarkable-looking man, tall,\\n      handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished\\n      features.\\n\\n      “Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?”\\n\\n      “Is it ready?”\\n\\n      “In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your\\n      rooms. My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you\\n      until you have made your fresh arrangements, but you will\\n      understand that under the new conditions this house will require\\n      a considerable staff.”\\n\\n      “What new conditions?”\\n\\n      “I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and\\n      we were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish\\n      to have more company, and so you will need changes in your\\n      household.”\\n\\n      “Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?”\\n\\n      “Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.”\\n\\n      “But your family have been with us for several generations, have\\n      they not? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an\\n      old family connection.”\\n\\n      I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler’s white\\n      face.\\n\\n      “I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the\\n      truth, sir, we were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and\\n      his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very\\n      painful to us. I fear that we shall never again be easy in our\\n      minds at Baskerville Hall.”\\n\\n      “But what do you intend to do?”\\n\\n      “I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing\\n      ourselves in some business. Sir Charles’s generosity has given us\\n      the means to do so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to\\n      your rooms.”\\n\\n      A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,\\n      approached by a double stair. From this central point two long\\n      corridors extended the whole length of the building, from which\\n      all the bedrooms opened. My own was in the same wing as\\n      Baskerville’s and almost next door to it. These rooms appeared to\\n      be much more modern than the central part of the house, and the\\n      bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the\\n      sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind.\\n\\n      But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of\\n      shadow and gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating\\n      the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for\\n      their dependents. At one end a minstrel’s gallery overlooked it.\\n      Black beams shot across above our heads, with a smoke-darkened\\n      ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches to light it up,\\n      and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might\\n      have softened; but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in\\n      the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one’s voice\\n      became hushed and one’s spirit subdued. A dim line of ancestors,\\n      in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the\\n      buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by their\\n      silent company. We talked little, and I for one was glad when the\\n      meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern\\n      billiard-room and smoke a cigarette.\\n\\n      “My word, it isn’t a very cheerful place,” said Sir Henry. “I\\n      suppose one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the\\n      picture at present. I don’t wonder that my uncle got a little\\n      jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this. However, if\\n      it suits you, we will retire early tonight, and perhaps things\\n      may seem more cheerful in the morning.”\\n\\n      I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from\\n      my window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of\\n      the hall door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a\\n      rising wind. A half moon broke through the rifts of racing\\n      clouds. In its cold light I saw beyond the trees a broken fringe\\n      of rocks, and the long, low curve of the melancholy moor. I\\n      closed the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in\\n      keeping with the rest.\\n\\n      And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet\\n      wakeful, tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the\\n      sleep which would not come. Far away a chiming clock struck out\\n      the quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay\\n      upon the old house. And then suddenly, in the very dead of the\\n      night, there came a sound to my ears, clear, resonant, and\\n      unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling\\n      gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow. I sat up in\\n      bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been far away\\n      and was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with\\n      every nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the\\n      chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7.\\n\\nThe Stapletons of Merripit House\\n\\n      The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface\\n      from our minds the grim and grey impression which had been left\\n      upon both of us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As\\n      Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through\\n      the high mullioned windows, throwing watery patches of colour\\n      from the coats of arms which covered them. The dark panelling\\n      glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard to realise\\n      that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom\\n      into our souls upon the evening before.\\n\\n      “I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to\\n      blame!” said the baronet. “We were tired with our journey and\\n      chilled by our drive, so we took a grey view of the place. Now we\\n      are fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more.”\\n\\n      “And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,” I\\n      answered. “Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman\\n      I think, sobbing in the night?”\\n\\n      “That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I\\n      heard something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was\\n      no more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.”\\n\\n      “I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob\\n      of a woman.”\\n\\n      “We must ask about this right away.” He rang the bell and asked\\n      Barrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed\\n      to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler\\n      still as he listened to his master’s question.\\n\\n      “There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,” he answered.\\n      “One is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The\\n      other is my wife, and I can answer for it that the sound could\\n      not have come from her.”\\n\\n      And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after\\n      breakfast I met Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun\\n      full upon her face. She was a large, impassive, heavy-featured\\n      woman with a stern set expression of mouth. But her telltale eyes\\n      were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids. It was she,\\n      then, who wept in the night, and if she did so her husband must\\n      know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in\\n      declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did\\n      she weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome,\\n      black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery\\n      and of gloom. It was he who had been the first to discover the\\n      body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the\\n      circumstances which led up to the old man’s death. Was it\\n      possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen in\\n      the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the\\n      same. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such\\n      an impression might easily have been erroneous. How could I\\n      settle the point forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to\\n      see the Grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had\\n      really been placed in Barrymore’s own hands. Be the answer what\\n      it might, I should at least have something to report to Sherlock\\n      Holmes.\\n\\n      Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that\\n      the time was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk\\n      of four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a\\n      small grey hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to\\n      be the inn and the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the\\n      rest. The postmaster, who was also the village grocer, had a\\n      clear recollection of the telegram.\\n\\n      “Certainly, sir,” said he, “I had the telegram delivered to Mr.\\n      Barrymore exactly as directed.”\\n\\n      “Who delivered it?”\\n\\n      “My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore\\n      at the Hall last week, did you not?”\\n\\n      “Yes, father, I delivered it.”\\n\\n      “Into his own hands?” I asked.\\n\\n      “Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put\\n      it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore’s hands,\\n      and she promised to deliver it at once.”\\n\\n      “Did you see Mr. Barrymore?”\\n\\n      “No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.”\\n\\n      “If you didn’t see him, how do you know he was in the loft?”\\n\\n      “Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,” said the\\n      postmaster testily. “Didn’t he get the telegram? If there is any\\n      mistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.”\\n\\n      It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was\\n      clear that in spite of Holmes’s ruse we had no proof that\\n      Barrymore had not been in London all the time. Suppose that it\\n      were so—suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen\\n      Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when he\\n      returned to England. What then? Was he the agent of others or had\\n      he some sinister design of his own? What interest could he have\\n      in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the strange\\n      warning clipped out of the leading article of the _Times_. Was\\n      that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was\\n      bent upon counteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive\\n      was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the\\n      family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home\\n      would be secured for the Barrymores. But surely such an\\n      explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the\\n      deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible\\n      net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that no more\\n      complex case had come to him in all the long series of his\\n      sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the\\n      grey, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his\\n      preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of\\n      responsibility from my shoulders.\\n\\n      Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running\\n      feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned,\\n      expecting to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a\\n      stranger who was pursuing me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven,\\n      prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and lean-jawed, between thirty and\\n      forty years of age, dressed in a grey suit and wearing a straw\\n      hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and\\n      he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands.\\n\\n      “You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,” said he\\n      as he came panting up to where I stood. “Here on the moor we are\\n      homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions. You may\\n      possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I\\n      am Stapleton, of Merripit House.”\\n\\n      “Your net and box would have told me as much,” said I, “for I\\n      knew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know\\n      me?”\\n\\n      “I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me\\n      from the window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the\\n      same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce\\n      myself. I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his\\n      journey?”\\n\\n      “He is very well, thank you.”\\n\\n      “We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir\\n      Charles the new baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking\\n      much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of\\n      this kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very great\\n      deal to the countryside. Sir Henry has, I suppose, no\\n      superstitious fears in the matter?”\\n\\n      “I do not think that it is likely.”\\n\\n      “Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the\\n      family?”\\n\\n      “I have heard it.”\\n\\n      “It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here!\\n      Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a\\n      creature upon the moor.” He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to\\n      read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously. “The\\n      story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and\\n      I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end.”\\n\\n      “But how?”\\n\\n      “His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog\\n      might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy\\n      that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night\\n      in the yew alley. I feared that some disaster might occur, for I\\n      was very fond of the old man, and I knew that his heart was\\n      weak.”\\n\\n      “How did you know that?”\\n\\n      “My friend Mortimer told me.”\\n\\n      “You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he\\n      died of fright in consequence?”\\n\\n      “Have you any better explanation?”\\n\\n      “I have not come to any conclusion.”\\n\\n      “Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”\\n\\n      The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the\\n      placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no\\n      surprise was intended.\\n\\n      “It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr.\\n      Watson,” said he. “The records of your detective have reached us\\n      here, and you could not celebrate him without being known\\n      yourself. When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny your\\n      identity. If you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock\\n      Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally\\n      curious to know what view he may take.”\\n\\n      “I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.”\\n\\n      “May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?”\\n\\n      “He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage\\n      his attention.”\\n\\n      “What a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark\\n      to us. But as to your own researches, if there is any possible\\n      way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will\\n      command me. If I had any indication of the nature of your\\n      suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, I might\\n      perhaps even now give you some aid or advice.”\\n\\n      “I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend,\\n      Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.”\\n\\n      “Excellent!” said Stapleton. “You are perfectly right to be wary\\n      and discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an\\n      unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not\\n      mention the matter again.”\\n\\n      We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from\\n      the road and wound away across the moor. A steep,\\n      boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone\\n      days been cut into a granite quarry. The face which was turned\\n      towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growing\\n      in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a grey\\n      plume of smoke.\\n\\n      “A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit\\n      House,” said he. “Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have\\n      the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.”\\n\\n      My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry’s side. But\\n      then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his\\n      study table was littered. It was certain that I could not help\\n      with those. And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the\\n      neighbours upon the moor. I accepted Stapleton’s invitation, and\\n      we turned together down the path.\\n\\n      “It is a wonderful place, the moor,” said he, looking round over\\n      the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged\\n      granite foaming up into fantastic surges. “You never tire of the\\n      moor. You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains.\\n      It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious.”\\n\\n      “You know it well, then?”\\n\\n      “I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a\\n      newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my\\n      tastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and I\\n      should think that there are few men who know it better than I\\n      do.”\\n\\n      “Is it hard to know?”\\n\\n      “Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north\\n      here with the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe\\n      anything remarkable about that?”\\n\\n      “It would be a rare place for a gallop.”\\n\\n      “You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several\\n      their lives before now. You notice those bright green spots\\n      scattered thickly over it?”\\n\\n      “Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.”\\n\\n      Stapleton laughed. “That is the great Grimpen Mire,” said he. “A\\n      false step yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I\\n      saw one of the moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I\\n      saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole,\\n      but it sucked him down at last. Even in dry seasons it is a\\n      danger to cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awful\\n      place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and\\n      return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable\\n      ponies!”\\n\\n      Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges.\\n      Then a long, agonised, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful\\n      cry echoed over the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my\\n      companion’s nerves seemed to be stronger than mine.\\n\\n      “It’s gone!” said he. “The mire has him. Two in two days, and\\n      many more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the\\n      dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them\\n      in its clutches. It’s a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.”\\n\\n      “And you say you can penetrate it?”\\n\\n      “Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can\\n      take. I have found them out.”\\n\\n      “But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?”\\n\\n      “Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off\\n      on all sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them\\n      in the course of years. That is where the rare plants and the\\n      butterflies are, if you have the wit to reach them.”\\n\\n      “I shall try my luck some day.”\\n\\n      He looked at me with a surprised face. “For God’s sake put such\\n      an idea out of your mind,” said he. “Your blood would be upon my\\n      head. I assure you that there would not be the least chance of\\n      your coming back alive. It is only by remembering certain complex\\n      landmarks that I am able to do it.”\\n\\n      “Halloa!” I cried. “What is that?”\\n\\n      A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It\\n      filled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it\\n      came. From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then\\n      sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again.\\n      Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face.\\n\\n      “Queer place, the moor!” said he.\\n\\n      “But what is it?”\\n\\n      “The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for\\n      its prey. I’ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so\\n      loud.”\\n\\n      I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge\\n      swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing\\n      stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which\\n      croaked loudly from a tor behind us.\\n\\n      “You are an educated man. You don’t believe such nonsense as\\n      that?” said I. “What do you think is the cause of so strange a\\n      sound?”\\n\\n      “Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It’s the mud settling, or the\\n      water rising, or something.”\\n\\n      “No, no, that was a living voice.”\\n\\n      “Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?”\\n\\n      “No, I never did.”\\n\\n      “It’s a very rare bird—practically extinct—in England now, but\\n      all things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be\\n      surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last\\n      of the bitterns.”\\n\\n      “It’s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my\\n      life.”\\n\\n      “Yes, it’s rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the\\n      hillside yonder. What do you make of those?”\\n\\n      The whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings of\\n      stone, a score of them at least.\\n\\n      “What are they? Sheep-pens?”\\n\\n      “No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man\\n      lived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived\\n      there since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as he\\n      left them. These are his wigwams with the roofs off. You can even\\n      see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go\\n      inside.\\n\\n      “But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?”\\n\\n      “Neolithic man—no date.”\\n\\n      “What did he do?”\\n\\n      “He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for\\n      tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look\\n      at the great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes,\\n      you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr.\\n      Watson. Oh, excuse me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides.”\\n\\n      A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an\\n      instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed\\n      in pursuit of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the\\n      great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an instant,\\n      bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the\\n      air. His grey clothes and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made\\n      him not unlike some huge moth himself. I was standing watching\\n      his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary\\n      activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the\\n      treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning\\n      round, found a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the\\n      direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of\\n      Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was\\n      quite close.\\n\\n      I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had\\n      been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor,\\n      and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a\\n      beauty. The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a\\n      most uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast\\n      between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted,\\n      with light hair and grey eyes, while she was darker than any\\n      brunette whom I have seen in England—slim, elegant, and tall. She\\n      had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have\\n      seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the\\n      beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant\\n      dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely\\n      moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then\\n      she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat and was\\n      about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned\\n      all my thoughts into a new channel.\\n\\n      “Go back!” she said. “Go straight back to London, instantly.”\\n\\n      I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at\\n      me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.\\n\\n      “Why should I go back?” I asked.\\n\\n      “I cannot explain.” She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a\\n      curious lisp in her utterance. “But for God’s sake do what I ask\\n      you. Go back and never set foot upon the moor again.”\\n\\n      “But I have only just come.”\\n\\n      “Man, man!” she cried. “Can you not tell when a warning is for\\n      your own good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from\\n      this place at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word\\n      of what I have said. Would you mind getting that orchid for me\\n      among the mare’s-tails yonder? We are very rich in orchids on the\\n      moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties\\n      of the place.”\\n\\n      Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing\\n      hard and flushed with his exertions.\\n\\n      “Halloa, Beryl!” said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of\\n      his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.\\n\\n      “Well, Jack, you are very hot.”\\n\\n      “Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom\\n      found in the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed\\n      him!” He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced\\n      incessantly from the girl to me.\\n\\n      “You have introduced yourselves, I can see.”\\n\\n      “Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to\\n      see the true beauties of the moor.”\\n\\n      “Why, who do you think this is?”\\n\\n      “I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.”\\n\\n      “No, no,” said I. “Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My\\n      name is Dr. Watson.”\\n\\n      A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. “We have\\n      been talking at cross purposes,” said she.\\n\\n      “Why, you had not very much time for talk,” her brother remarked\\n      with the same questioning eyes.\\n\\n      “I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being\\n      merely a visitor,” said she. “It cannot much matter to him\\n      whether it is early or late for the orchids. But you will come\\n      on, will you not, and see Merripit House?”\\n\\n      A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the\\n      farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into\\n      repair and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded\\n      it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and\\n      nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean and\\n      melancholy. We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated\\n      old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house. Inside,\\n      however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in\\n      which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I looked\\n      from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor\\n      rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel\\n      at what could have brought this highly educated man and this\\n      beautiful woman to live in such a place.\\n\\n      “Queer spot to choose, is it not?” said he as if in answer to my\\n      thought. “And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we\\n      not, Beryl?”\\n\\n      “Quite happy,” said she, but there was no ring of conviction in\\n      her words.\\n\\n      “I had a school,” said Stapleton. “It was in the north country.\\n      The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and\\n      uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping\\n      to mould those young minds, and of impressing them with one’s own\\n      character and ideals was very dear to me. However, the fates were\\n      against us. A serious epidemic broke out in the school and three\\n      of the boys died. It never recovered from the blow, and much of\\n      my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet, if it were\\n      not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, I\\n      could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes\\n      for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here,\\n      and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr.\\n      Watson, has been brought upon your head by your expression as you\\n      surveyed the moor out of our window.”\\n\\n      “It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little\\n      dull—less for you, perhaps, than for your sister.”\\n\\n      “No, no, I am never dull,” said she quickly.\\n\\n      “We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting\\n      neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line.\\n      Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. We knew him\\n      well and miss him more than I can tell. Do you think that I\\n      should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the\\n      acquaintance of Sir Henry?”\\n\\n      “I am sure that he would be delighted.”\\n\\n      “Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may\\n      in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him\\n      until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you\\n      come upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection of\\n      Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in the\\n      south-west of England. By the time that you have looked through\\n      them lunch will be almost ready.”\\n\\n      But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the\\n      moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which\\n      had been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all\\n      these things tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of\\n      these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite\\n      and distinct warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such\\n      intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave and\\n      deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all pressure to stay for\\n      lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking the\\n      grass-grown path by which we had come.\\n\\n      It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for\\n      those who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was\\n      astounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side\\n      of the track. Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions\\n      and she held her hand to her side.\\n\\n      “I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,”\\n      said she. “I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop,\\n      or my brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am\\n      about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir\\n      Henry. Please forget the words I said, which have no application\\n      whatever to you.”\\n\\n      “But I can’t forget them, Miss Stapleton,” said I. “I am Sir\\n      Henry’s friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine.\\n      Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should\\n      return to London.”\\n\\n      “A woman’s whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will\\n      understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or\\n      do.”\\n\\n      “No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look\\n      in your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton,\\n      for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows\\n      all round me. Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with\\n      little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with\\n      no guide to point the track. Tell me then what it was that you\\n      meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry.”\\n\\n      An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her\\n      face, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.\\n\\n      “You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,” said she. “My brother and\\n      I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him\\n      very intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our\\n      house. He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the\\n      family, and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there\\n      must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was\\n      distressed therefore when another member of the family came down\\n      to live here, and I felt that he should be warned of the danger\\n      which he will run. That was all which I intended to convey.\\n\\n      “But what is the danger?”\\n\\n      “You know the story of the hound?”\\n\\n      “I do not believe in such nonsense.”\\n\\n      “But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him\\n      away from a place which has always been fatal to his family. The\\n      world is wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of\\n      danger?”\\n\\n      “Because it _is_ the place of danger. That is Sir Henry’s nature.\\n      I fear that unless you can give me some more definite information\\n      than this it would be impossible to get him to move.”\\n\\n      “I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything\\n      definite.”\\n\\n      “I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant\\n      no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not\\n      wish your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to\\n      which he, or anyone else, could object.”\\n\\n      “My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he\\n      thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He\\n      would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which\\n      might induce Sir Henry to go away. But I have done my duty now\\n      and I will say no more. I must go back, or he will miss me and\\n      suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!” She turned and had\\n      disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while\\n      I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to\\n      Baskerville Hall.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8.\\n\\nFirst Report of Dr. Watson\\n\\n      From this point onward I will follow the course of events by\\n      transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie\\n      before me on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they\\n      are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the\\n      moment more accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these\\n      tragic events, can possibly do.\\n\\n      Baskerville Hall, October 13th.\\n\\n      MY DEAR HOLMES,\\n\\n      My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to\\n      date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner\\n      of the world. The longer one stays here the more does the spirit\\n      of the moor sink into one’s soul, its vastness, and also its grim\\n      charm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all\\n      traces of modern England behind you, but, on the other hand, you\\n      are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the\\n      prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the\\n      houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge\\n      monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As you\\n      look at their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides you\\n      leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a\\n      skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a\\n      flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel\\n      that his presence there was more natural than your own. The\\n      strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what\\n      must always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian,\\n      but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried\\n      race who were forced to accept that which none other would\\n      occupy.\\n\\n      All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me\\n      and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely\\n      practical mind. I can still remember your complete indifference\\n      as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round\\n      the sun. Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir\\n      Henry Baskerville.\\n\\n      If you have not had any report within the last few days it is\\n      because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate.\\n      Then a very surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell\\n      you in due course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touch\\n      with some of the other factors in the situation.\\n\\n      One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped\\n      convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that\\n      he has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the\\n      lonely householders of this district. A fortnight has passed\\n      since his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing\\n      has been heard of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could\\n      have held out upon the moor during all that time. Of course, so\\n      far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all. Any\\n      one of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place. But there\\n      is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of\\n      the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone, and the\\n      outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.\\n\\n      We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could\\n      take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy\\n      moments when I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles\\n      from any help. There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister,\\n      and the brother, the latter not a very strong man. They would be\\n      helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this Notting\\n      Hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance. Both Sir Henry\\n      and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested\\n      that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, but\\n      Stapleton would not hear of it.\\n\\n      The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a\\n      considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be\\n      wondered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an\\n      active man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful\\n      woman. There is something tropical and exotic about her which\\n      forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother.\\n      Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires. He has certainly a\\n      very marked influence over her, for I have seen her continually\\n      glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what\\n      she said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is a dry glitter\\n      in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a\\n      positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an\\n      interesting study.\\n\\n      He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the\\n      very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the\\n      legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It\\n      was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which\\n      is so dismal that it might have suggested the story. We found a\\n      short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy\\n      space flecked over with the white cotton grass. In the middle of\\n      it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end\\n      until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous\\n      beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old\\n      tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more\\n      than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the\\n      interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke\\n      lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest.\\n      Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that\\n      he said less than he might, and that he would not express his\\n      whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the\\n      baronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had suffered\\n      from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that\\n      he shared the popular view upon the matter.\\n\\n      On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was\\n      there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton.\\n      From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly\\n      attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not\\n      mutual. He referred to her again and again on our walk home, and\\n      since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen\\n      something of the brother and sister. They dine here tonight, and\\n      there is some talk of our going to them next week. One would\\n      imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and\\n      yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest\\n      disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some\\n      attention to his sister. He is much attached to her, no doubt,\\n      and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the\\n      height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her\\n      making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that he does not\\n      wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times\\n      observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being\\n      _tête-à-tête_. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow\\n      Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a\\n      love affair were to be added to our other difficulties. My\\n      popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders\\n      to the letter.\\n\\n      The other day—Thursday, to be more exact—Dr. Mortimer lunched\\n      with us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got\\n      a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. Never was\\n      there such a single-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came\\n      in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley\\n      at Sir Henry’s request to show us exactly how everything occurred\\n      upon that fatal night. It is a long, dismal walk, the yew alley,\\n      between two high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of\\n      grass upon either side. At the far end is an old tumble-down\\n      summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where the old\\n      gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with a\\n      latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of\\n      the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old\\n      man stood there he saw something coming across the moor,\\n      something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran\\n      and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion. There was\\n      the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. And from what? A\\n      sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and\\n      monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter? Did the pale,\\n      watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was all dim\\n      and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind\\n      it.\\n\\n      One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.\\n      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south\\n      of us. He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and\\n      choleric. His passion is for the British law, and he has spent a\\n      large fortune in litigation. He fights for the mere pleasure of\\n      fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a\\n      question, so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly\\n      amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the\\n      parish to make him open it. At others he will with his own hands\\n      tear down some other man’s gate and declare that a path has\\n      existed there from time immemorial, defying the owner to\\n      prosecute him for trespass. He is learned in old manorial and\\n      communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour\\n      of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so\\n      that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the\\n      village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest\\n      exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands\\n      at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his\\n      fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the\\n      future. Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured\\n      person, and I only mention him because you were particular that I\\n      should send some description of the people who surround us. He is\\n      curiously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer,\\n      he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roof\\n      of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of\\n      catching a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would confine\\n      his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours\\n      that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave\\n      without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the\\n      Neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our\\n      lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where\\n      it is badly needed.\\n\\n      And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict,\\n      the Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let\\n      me end on that which is most important and tell you more about\\n      the Barrymores, and especially about the surprising development\\n      of last night.\\n\\n      First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London\\n      in order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have\\n      already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that\\n      the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the\\n      other. I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in\\n      his downright fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether he\\n      had received the telegram himself. Barrymore said that he had.\\n\\n      “Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?” asked Sir Henry.\\n\\n      Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.\\n\\n      “No,” said he, “I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife\\n      brought it up to me.”\\n\\n      “Did you answer it yourself?”\\n\\n      “No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write\\n      it.”\\n\\n      In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.\\n\\n      “I could not quite understand the object of your questions this\\n      morning, Sir Henry,” said he. “I trust that they do not mean that\\n      I have done anything to forfeit your confidence?”\\n\\n      Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by\\n      giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London\\n      outfit having now all arrived.\\n\\n      Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid\\n      person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be\\n      puritanical. You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject.\\n      Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard her\\n      sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed\\n      traces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her\\n      heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts\\n      her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic\\n      tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular and\\n      questionable in this man’s character, but the adventure of last\\n      night brings all my suspicions to a head.\\n\\n      And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that\\n      I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in\\n      this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night,\\n      about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step\\n      passing my room. I rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A long\\n      black shadow was trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a\\n      man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his\\n      hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet.\\n      I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it\\n      was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there\\n      was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole\\n      appearance.\\n\\n      I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which\\n      runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther\\n      side. I waited until he had passed out of sight and then I\\n      followed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached the\\n      end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of\\n      light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms.\\n      Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his\\n      expedition became more mysterious than ever. The light shone\\n      steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the\\n      passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of\\n      the door.\\n\\n      Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held\\n      against the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and\\n      his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out\\n      into the blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood\\n      watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with an\\n      impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my way\\n      back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing\\n      once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had\\n      fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock,\\n      but I could not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I\\n      cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this\\n      house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom\\n      of. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to\\n      furnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir\\n      Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded\\n      upon my observations of last night. I will not speak about it\\n      just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9.\\n\\nThe Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Watson]\\n\\n      Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th.\\n\\n      MY DEAR HOLMES,\\n\\n      If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the\\n      early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up\\n      for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast\\n      upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note with\\n      Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already\\n      which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you.\\n      Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In\\n      some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much\\n      clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated. But I\\n      will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself.\\n\\n      Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went\\n      down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had\\n      been on the night before. The western window through which he had\\n      stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all\\n      other windows in the house—it commands the nearest outlook on to\\n      the moor. There is an opening between two trees which enables one\\n      from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from\\n      all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be\\n      obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this\\n      window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for\\n      something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so\\n      that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone.\\n      It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was\\n      on foot. That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and\\n      also for the uneasiness of his wife. The man is a\\n      striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of\\n      a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to\\n      support it. That opening of the door which I had heard after I\\n      had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep\\n      some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the\\n      morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however\\n      much the result may have shown that they were unfounded.\\n\\n      But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore’s movements might\\n      be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself\\n      until I could explain them was more than I could bear. I had an\\n      interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I\\n      told him all that I had seen. He was less surprised than I had\\n      expected.\\n\\n      “I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to\\n      speak to him about it,” said he. “Two or three times I have heard\\n      his steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour\\n      you name.”\\n\\n      “Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular\\n      window,” I suggested.\\n\\n      “Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see\\n      what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes\\n      would do if he were here.”\\n\\n      “I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,” said\\n      I. “He would follow Barrymore and see what he did.”\\n\\n      “Then we shall do it together.”\\n\\n      “But surely he would hear us.”\\n\\n      “The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance\\n      of that. We’ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he\\n      passes.” Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was\\n      evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat\\n      quiet life upon the moor.\\n\\n      The baronet has been in communication with the architect who\\n      prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from\\n      London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon.\\n      There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, and\\n      it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare\\n      no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. When\\n      the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need\\n      will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there are\\n      pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is\\n      willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a\\n      woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton.\\n      And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as\\n      one would under the circumstances expect. Today, for example, its\\n      surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused\\n      our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance.\\n\\n      After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir\\n      Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of\\n      course I did the same.\\n\\n      “What, are _you_ coming, Watson?” he asked, looking at me in a\\n      curious way.\\n\\n      “That depends on whether you are going on the moor,” said I.\\n\\n      “Yes, I am.”\\n\\n      “Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude,\\n      but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not\\n      leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the\\n      moor.”\\n\\n      Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.\\n\\n      “My dear fellow,” said he, “Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not\\n      foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the\\n      moor. You understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in\\n      the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out\\n      alone.”\\n\\n      It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say\\n      or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his\\n      cane and was gone.\\n\\n      But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached\\n      me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my\\n      sight. I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to\\n      you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my\\n      disregard for your instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed\\n      at the very thought. It might not even now be too late to\\n      overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit\\n      House.\\n\\n      I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing\\n      anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor\\n      path branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the\\n      wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could\\n      command a view—the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry.\\n      Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor path about a quarter\\n      of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss\\n      Stapleton. It was clear that there was already an understanding\\n      between them and that they had met by appointment. They were\\n      walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making\\n      quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest\\n      in what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or\\n      twice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks\\n      watching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next. To\\n      follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to\\n      be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to\\n      let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend was a\\n      hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observe\\n      him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to\\n      him afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden\\n      danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and\\n      yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was\\n      very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do.\\n\\n      Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and\\n      were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was\\n      suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their\\n      interview. A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and\\n      another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man\\n      who was moving among the broken ground. It was Stapleton with his\\n      butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was,\\n      and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this instant\\n      Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was\\n      round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from\\n      him with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she\\n      raised one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring\\n      apart and turn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the\\n      interruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net\\n      dangling behind him. He gesticulated and almost danced with\\n      excitement in front of the lovers. What the scene meant I could\\n      not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir\\n      Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the\\n      other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in haughty\\n      silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a\\n      peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at\\n      Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother. The\\n      naturalist’s angry gestures showed that the lady was included in\\n      his displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute looking after\\n      them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come,\\n      his head hanging, the very picture of dejection.\\n\\n      What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed\\n      to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend’s\\n      knowledge. I ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at\\n      the bottom. His face was flushed with anger and his brows were\\n      wrinkled, like one who is at his wit’s ends what to do.\\n\\n      “Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?” said he. “You\\n      don’t mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?”\\n\\n      I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to\\n      remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed\\n      all that had occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but\\n      my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a\\n      rather rueful laugh.\\n\\n      “You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe\\n      place for a man to be private,” said he, “but, by thunder, the\\n      whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my\\n      wooing—and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a\\n      seat?”\\n\\n      “I was on that hill.”\\n\\n      “Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the\\n      front. Did you see him come out on us?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I did.”\\n\\n      “Did he ever strike you as being crazy—this brother of hers?”\\n\\n      “I can’t say that he ever did.”\\n\\n      “I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today,\\n      but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a\\n      straitjacket. What’s the matter with me, anyhow? You’ve lived\\n      near me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there\\n      anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a\\n      woman that I loved?”\\n\\n      “I should say not.”\\n\\n      “He can’t object to my worldly position, so it must be myself\\n      that he has this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt\\n      man or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not so\\n      much as let me touch the tips of her fingers.”\\n\\n      “Did he say so?”\\n\\n      “That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I’ve only known her\\n      these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made\\n      for me, and she, too—she was happy when she was with me, and that\\n      I’ll swear. There’s a light in a woman’s eyes that speaks louder\\n      than words. But he has never let us get together and it was only\\n      today for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few\\n      words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did\\n      it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn’t have\\n      let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She\\n      kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that\\n      she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that\\n      since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if\\n      she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her\\n      to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to\\n      marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of\\n      hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just\\n      white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with\\n      fury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her\\n      attentions which were distasteful to her? Did I think that\\n      because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had not\\n      been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As\\n      it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such\\n      as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour\\n      me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better,\\n      so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more\\n      hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing\\n      by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here\\n      am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me\\n      what it all means, Watson, and I’ll owe you more than ever I can\\n      hope to pay.”\\n\\n      I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely\\n      puzzled myself. Our friend’s title, his fortune, his age, his\\n      character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know\\n      nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his\\n      family. That his advances should be rejected so brusquely without\\n      any reference to the lady’s own wishes and that the lady should\\n      accept the situation without protest is very amazing. However,\\n      our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton\\n      himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies for\\n      his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview\\n      with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was\\n      that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at\\n      Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it.\\n\\n      “I don’t say now that he isn’t a crazy man,” said Sir Henry; “I\\n      can’t forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning,\\n      but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology\\n      than he has done.”\\n\\n      “Did he give any explanation of his conduct?”\\n\\n      “His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural\\n      enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value. They\\n      have always been together, and according to his account he has\\n      been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the\\n      thought of losing her was really terrible to him. He had not\\n      understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but\\n      when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she\\n      might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for a\\n      time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He was very\\n      sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and\\n      how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a\\n      beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If\\n      she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like\\n      myself than to anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him\\n      and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself\\n      to meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I\\n      would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be\\n      content with cultivating the lady’s friendship during that time\\n      without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the matter\\n      rests.”\\n\\n      So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is\\n      something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we\\n      are floundering. We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour\\n      upon his sister’s suitor—even when that suitor was so eligible a\\n      one as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to another thread which I\\n      have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs\\n      in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the\\n      secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window.\\n      Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not\\n      disappointed you as an agent—that you do not regret the\\n      confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All\\n      these things have by one night’s work been thoroughly cleared.\\n\\n      I have said “by one night’s work,” but, in truth, it was by two\\n      nights’ work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up\\n      with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o’clock in the\\n      morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming\\n      clock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy vigil and ended\\n      by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately we were\\n      not discouraged, and we determined to try again. The next night\\n      we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the\\n      least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by,\\n      and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient\\n      interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into\\n      which he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we\\n      had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an\\n      instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary\\n      senses keenly on the alert once more. We had heard the creak of a\\n      step in the passage.\\n\\n      Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the\\n      distance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out\\n      in pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the\\n      corridor was all in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had\\n      come into the other wing. We were just in time to catch a glimpse\\n      of the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded as he\\n      tiptoed down the passage. Then he passed through the same door as\\n      before, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and\\n      shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor. We\\n      shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every plank before we\\n      dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the\\n      precaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old\\n      boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed\\n      impossible that he should fail to hear our approach. However, the\\n      man is fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied\\n      in that which he was doing. When at last we reached the door and\\n      peeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle in\\n      hand, his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly as\\n      I had seen him two nights before.\\n\\n      We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to\\n      whom the most direct way is always the most natural. He walked\\n      into the room, and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the\\n      window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood, livid and\\n      trembling, before us. His dark eyes, glaring out of the white\\n      mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he\\n      gazed from Sir Henry to me.\\n\\n      “What are you doing here, Barrymore?”\\n\\n      “Nothing, sir.” His agitation was so great that he could hardly\\n      speak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his\\n      candle. “It was the window, sir. I go round at night to see that\\n      they are fastened.”\\n\\n      “On the second floor?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, all the windows.”\\n\\n      “Look here, Barrymore,” said Sir Henry sternly, “we have made up\\n      our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you\\n      trouble to tell it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies!\\n      What were you doing at that window?”\\n\\n      The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands\\n      together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and\\n      misery.\\n\\n      “I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.”\\n\\n      “And why were you holding a candle to the window?”\\n\\n      “Don’t ask me, Sir Henry—don’t ask me! I give you my word, sir,\\n      that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it\\n      concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you.”\\n\\n      A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the\\n      trembling hand of the butler.\\n\\n      “He must have been holding it as a signal,” said I. “Let us see\\n      if there is any answer.” I held it as he had done, and stared out\\n      into the darkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black\\n      bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the\\n      moon was behind the clouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation,\\n      for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the\\n      dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square\\n      framed by the window.\\n\\n      “There it is!” I cried.\\n\\n      “No, no, sir, it is nothing—nothing at all!” the butler broke in;\\n      “I assure you, sir—”\\n\\n      “Move your light across the window, Watson!” cried the baronet.\\n      “See, the other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it\\n      is a signal? Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder,\\n      and what is this conspiracy that is going on?”\\n\\n      The man’s face became openly defiant. “It is my business, and not\\n      yours. I will not tell.”\\n\\n      “Then you leave my employment right away.”\\n\\n      “Very good, sir. If I must I must.”\\n\\n      “And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of\\n      yourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred\\n      years under this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot\\n      against me.”\\n\\n      “No, no, sir; no, not against you!” It was a woman’s voice, and\\n      Mrs. Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband,\\n      was standing at the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt\\n      might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling\\n      upon her face.\\n\\n      “We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our\\n      things,” said the butler.\\n\\n      “Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing, Sir\\n      Henry—all mine. He has done nothing except for my sake and\\n      because I asked him.”\\n\\n      “Speak out, then! What does it mean?”\\n\\n      “My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let him\\n      perish at our very gates. The light is a signal to him that food\\n      is ready for him, and his light out yonder is to show the spot to\\n      which to bring it.”\\n\\n      “Then your brother is—”\\n\\n      “The escaped convict, sir—Selden, the criminal.”\\n\\n      “That’s the truth, sir,” said Barrymore. “I said that it was not\\n      my secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have\\n      heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not\\n      against you.”\\n\\n      This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at\\n      night and the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at\\n      the woman in amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly\\n      respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most\\n      notorious criminals in the country?\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We\\n      humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way\\n      in everything until he came to think that the world was made for\\n      his pleasure, and that he could do what he liked in it. Then as\\n      he grew older he met wicked companions, and the devil entered\\n      into him until he broke my mother’s heart and dragged our name in\\n      the dirt. From crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is\\n      only the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold;\\n      but to me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy that I\\n      had nursed and played with as an elder sister would. That was why\\n      he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and that we could\\n      not refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here one night,\\n      weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what\\n      could we do? We took him in and fed him and cared for him. Then\\n      you returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on\\n      the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he\\n      lay in hiding there. But every second night we made sure if he\\n      was still there by putting a light in the window, and if there\\n      was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him.\\n      Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long as he was there\\n      we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I am an\\n      honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in\\n      the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose\\n      sake he has done all that he has.”\\n\\n      The woman’s words came with an intense earnestness which carried\\n      conviction with them.\\n\\n      “Is this true, Barrymore?”\\n\\n      “Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.”\\n\\n      “Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget\\n      what I have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk\\n      further about this matter in the morning.”\\n\\n      When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry\\n      had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our\\n      faces. Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one\\n      tiny point of yellow light.\\n\\n      “I wonder he dares,” said Sir Henry.\\n\\n      “It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.”\\n\\n      “Very likely. How far do you think it is?”\\n\\n      “Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.”\\n\\n      “Not more than a mile or two off.”\\n\\n      “Hardly that.”\\n\\n      “Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to\\n      it. And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By\\n      thunder, Watson, I am going out to take that man!”\\n\\n      The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the\\n      Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had\\n      been forced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an\\n      unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse.\\n      We were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him\\n      back where he could do no harm. With his brutal and violent\\n      nature, others would have to pay the price if we held our hands.\\n      Any night, for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might be\\n      attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this which\\n      made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.\\n\\n      “I will come,” said I.\\n\\n      “Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we\\n      start the better, as the fellow may put out his light and be\\n      off.”\\n\\n      In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our\\n      expedition. We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull\\n      moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves.\\n      The night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and\\n      again the moon peeped out for an instant, but clouds were driving\\n      over the face of the sky, and just as we came out on the moor a\\n      thin rain began to fall. The light still burned steadily in\\n      front.\\n\\n      “Are you armed?” I asked.\\n\\n      “I have a hunting-crop.”\\n\\n      “We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a\\n      desperate fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at\\n      our mercy before he can resist.”\\n\\n      “I say, Watson,” said the baronet, “what would Holmes say to\\n      this? How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil\\n      is exalted?”\\n\\n      As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast\\n      gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon\\n      the borders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind\\n      through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a\\n      rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away. Again\\n      and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident,\\n      wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve and his face\\n      glimmered white through the darkness.\\n\\n      “My God, what’s that, Watson?”\\n\\n      “I don’t know. It’s a sound they have on the moor. I heard it\\n      once before.”\\n\\n      It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood\\n      straining our ears, but nothing came.\\n\\n      “Watson,” said the baronet, “it was the cry of a hound.”\\n\\n      My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice\\n      which told of the sudden horror which had seized him.\\n\\n      “What do they call this sound?” he asked.\\n\\n      “Who?”\\n\\n      “The folk on the countryside.”\\n\\n      “Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call\\n      it?”\\n\\n      “Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?”\\n\\n      I hesitated but could not escape the question.\\n\\n      “They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.”\\n\\n      He groaned and was silent for a few moments.\\n\\n      “A hound it was,” he said at last, “but it seemed to come from\\n      miles away, over yonder, I think.”\\n\\n      “It was hard to say whence it came.”\\n\\n      “It rose and fell with the wind. Isn’t that the direction of the\\n      great Grimpen Mire?”\\n\\n      “Yes, it is.”\\n\\n      “Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn’t you think\\n      yourself that it was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You\\n      need not fear to speak the truth.”\\n\\n      “Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it\\n      might be the calling of a strange bird.”\\n\\n      “No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all\\n      these stories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so\\n      dark a cause? You don’t believe it, do you, Watson?”\\n\\n      “No, no.”\\n\\n      “And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is\\n      another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear\\n      such a cry as that. And my uncle! There was the footprint of the\\n      hound beside him as he lay. It all fits together. I don’t think\\n      that I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze my\\n      very blood. Feel my hand!”\\n\\n      It was as cold as a block of marble.\\n\\n      “You’ll be all right tomorrow.”\\n\\n      “I don’t think I’ll get that cry out of my head. What do you\\n      advise that we do now?”\\n\\n      “Shall we turn back?”\\n\\n      “No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do\\n      it. We after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not,\\n      after us. Come on! We’ll see it through if all the fiends of the\\n      pit were loose upon the moor.”\\n\\n      We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of\\n      the craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning\\n      steadily in front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance\\n      of a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer\\n      seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might\\n      have been within a few yards of us. But at last we could see\\n      whence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed very close.\\n      A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which\\n      flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also\\n      to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of\\n      Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach,\\n      and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It\\n      was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle\\n      of the moor, with no sign of life near it—just the one straight\\n      yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it.\\n\\n      “What shall we do now?” whispered Sir Henry.\\n\\n      “Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a\\n      glimpse of him.”\\n\\n      The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over\\n      the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was\\n      thrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all\\n      seamed and scored with vile passions. Foul with mire, with a\\n      bristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well have\\n      belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on\\n      the hillsides. The light beneath him was reflected in his small,\\n      cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the\\n      darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps\\n      of the hunters.\\n\\n      Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been\\n      that Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to\\n      give, or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking\\n      that all was not well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked\\n      face. Any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the\\n      darkness. I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same.\\n      At the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and\\n      hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had\\n      sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, strongly\\n      built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run. At the\\n      same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.\\n      We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man\\n      running with great speed down the other side, springing over the\\n      stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky\\n      long shot of my revolver might have crippled him, but I had\\n      brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an\\n      unarmed man who was running away.\\n\\n      We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we\\n      soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him\\n      for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck\\n      moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant\\n      hill. We ran and ran until we were completely blown, but the\\n      space between us grew ever wider. Finally we stopped and sat\\n      panting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in the\\n      distance.\\n\\n      And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and\\n      unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to\\n      go home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low\\n      upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up\\n      against the lower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as\\n      black as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw the\\n      figure of a man upon the tor. Do not think that it was a\\n      delusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never in my life seen\\n      anything more clearly. As far as I could judge, the figure was\\n      that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs a little\\n      separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were\\n      brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which\\n      lay before him. He might have been the very spirit of that\\n      terrible place. It was not the convict. This man was far from the\\n      place where the latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much\\n      taller man. With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the\\n      baronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp\\n      his arm the man was gone. There was the sharp pinnacle of granite\\n      still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but its peak bore no\\n      trace of that silent and motionless figure.\\n\\n      I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it\\n      was some distance away. The baronet’s nerves were still quivering\\n      from that cry, which recalled the dark story of his family, and\\n      he was not in the mood for fresh adventures. He had not seen this\\n      lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his\\n      strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me. “A\\n      warder, no doubt,” said he. “The moor has been thick with them\\n      since this fellow escaped.” Well, perhaps his explanation may be\\n      the right one, but I should like to have some further proof of\\n      it. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where\\n      they should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that\\n      we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our\\n      own prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you must\\n      acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in\\n      the matter of a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite\\n      irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let\\n      you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those\\n      which will be of most service to you in helping you to your\\n      conclusions. We are certainly making some progress. So far as the\\n      Barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions, and that\\n      has cleared up the situation very much. But the moor with its\\n      mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as\\n      ever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to throw some light upon\\n      this also. Best of all would it be if you could come down to us.\\n      In any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next\\n      few days.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10.\\n\\nExtract from the Diary of Dr. Watson\\n\\n      So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have\\n      forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now,\\n      however, I have arrived at a point in my narrative where I am\\n      compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my\\n      recollections, aided by the diary which I kept at the time. A few\\n      extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which\\n      are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I proceed,\\n      then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the\\n      convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.\\n\\n      _October_ 16_th_.—A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain.\\n      The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and\\n      then to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver\\n      veins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant boulders\\n      gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces. It is\\n      melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a black reaction\\n      after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself of a\\n      weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger—ever present\\n      danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define\\n      it.\\n\\n      And have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long\\n      sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister\\n      influence which is at work around us. There is the death of the\\n      last occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions\\n      of the family legend, and there are the repeated reports from\\n      peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor.\\n      Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the\\n      distant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impossible, that it\\n      should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature. A spectral\\n      hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its\\n      howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may fall in\\n      with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one\\n      quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade\\n      me to believe in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to\\n      the level of these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere\\n      fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting\\n      from his mouth and eyes. Holmes would not listen to such fancies,\\n      and I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice heard\\n      this crying upon the moor. Suppose that there were really some\\n      huge hound loose upon it; that would go far to explain\\n      everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did\\n      it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one\\n      saw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation\\n      offers almost as many difficulties as the other. And always,\\n      apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency in\\n      London, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry\\n      against the moor. This at least was real, but it might have been\\n      the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy. Where\\n      is that friend or enemy now? Has he remained in London, or has he\\n      followed us down here? Could he—could he be the stranger whom I\\n      saw upon the tor?\\n\\n      It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet\\n      there are some things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one\\n      whom I have seen down here, and I have now met all the\\n      neighbours. The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, far\\n      thinner than that of Frankland. Barrymore it might possibly have\\n      been, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that he\\n      could not have followed us. A stranger then is still dogging us,\\n      just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never shaken him\\n      off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we might\\n      find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one\\n      purpose I must now devote all my energies.\\n\\n      My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second\\n      and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as\\n      possible to anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have\\n      been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor. I will say\\n      nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps to\\n      attain my own end.\\n\\n      We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore\\n      asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in\\n      his study some little time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more\\n      than once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a pretty\\n      good idea what the point was which was under discussion. After a\\n      time the baronet opened his door and called for me. “Barrymore\\n      considers that he has a grievance,” he said. “He thinks that it\\n      was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he,\\n      of his own free will, had told us the secret.”\\n\\n      The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.\\n\\n      “I may have spoken too warmly, sir,” said he, “and if I have, I\\n      am sure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much\\n      surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning\\n      and learned that you had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has\\n      enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track.”\\n\\n      “If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a\\n      different thing,” said the baronet, “you only told us, or rather\\n      your wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could\\n      not help yourself.”\\n\\n      “I didn’t think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir\\n      Henry—indeed I didn’t.”\\n\\n      “The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered\\n      over the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You\\n      only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr.\\n      Stapleton’s house, for example, with no one but himself to defend\\n      it. There’s no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key.”\\n\\n      “He’ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon\\n      that. But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I\\n      assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary\\n      arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to\\n      South America. For God’s sake, sir, I beg of you not to let the\\n      police know that he is still on the moor. They have given up the\\n      chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for\\n      him. You can’t tell on him without getting my wife and me into\\n      trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.”\\n\\n      “What do you say, Watson?”\\n\\n      I shrugged my shoulders. “If he were safely out of the country it\\n      would relieve the tax-payer of a burden.”\\n\\n      “But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he\\n      goes?”\\n\\n      “He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with\\n      all that he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he\\n      was hiding.”\\n\\n      “That is true,” said Sir Henry. “Well, Barrymore—”\\n\\n      “God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have\\n      killed my poor wife had he been taken again.”\\n\\n      “I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after\\n      what we have heard I don’t feel as if I could give the man up, so\\n      there is an end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.”\\n\\n      With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he\\n      hesitated and then came back.\\n\\n      “You’ve been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the\\n      best I can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and\\n      perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the\\n      inquest that I found it out. I’ve never breathed a word about it\\n      yet to mortal man. It’s about poor Sir Charles’s death.”\\n\\n      The baronet and I were both upon our feet. “Do you know how he\\n      died?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, I don’t know that.”\\n\\n      “What then?”\\n\\n      “I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a\\n      woman.”\\n\\n      “To meet a woman! He?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “And the woman’s name?”\\n\\n      “I can’t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials.\\n      Her initials were L. L.”\\n\\n      “How do you know this, Barrymore?”\\n\\n      “Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had\\n      usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and well\\n      known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was\\n      glad to turn to him. But that morning, as it chanced, there was\\n      only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. It was\\n      from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman’s hand.”\\n\\n      “Well?”\\n\\n      “Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have\\n      done had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was\\n      cleaning out Sir Charles’s study—it had never been touched since\\n      his death—and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back\\n      of the grate. The greater part of it was charred to pieces, but\\n      one little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and the\\n      writing could still be read, though it was grey on a black\\n      ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the\\n      letter and it said: ‘Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn\\n      this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were\\n      signed the initials L. L.”\\n\\n      “Have you got that slip?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.”\\n\\n      “Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?”\\n\\n      “Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should\\n      not have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.”\\n\\n      “And you have no idea who L. L. is?”\\n\\n      “No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our\\n      hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles’s\\n      death.”\\n\\n      “I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this\\n      important information.”\\n\\n      “Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to\\n      us. And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir\\n      Charles, as we well might be considering all that he has done for\\n      us. To rake this up couldn’t help our poor master, and it’s well\\n      to go carefully when there’s a lady in the case. Even the best of\\n      us—”\\n\\n      “You thought it might injure his reputation?”\\n\\n      “Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have\\n      been kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you\\n      unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter.”\\n\\n      “Very good, Barrymore; you can go.” When the butler had left us\\n      Sir Henry turned to me. “Well, Watson, what do you think of this\\n      new light?”\\n\\n      “It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.”\\n\\n      “So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up\\n      the whole business. We have gained that much. We know that there\\n      is someone who has the facts if we can only find her. What do you\\n      think we should do?”\\n\\n      “Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue\\n      for which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not\\n      bring him down.”\\n\\n      I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning’s\\n      conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been\\n      very busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street\\n      were few and short, with no comments upon the information which I\\n      had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission. No doubt his\\n      blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties. And yet this\\n      new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his\\n      interest. I wish that he were here.\\n\\n      _October_ 17_th_.—All day today the rain poured down, rustling on\\n      the ivy and dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict out\\n      upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his\\n      crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them. And then I\\n      thought of that other one—the face in the cab, the figure against\\n      the moon. Was he also out in that deluged—the unseen watcher, the\\n      man of darkness? In the evening I put on my waterproof and I\\n      walked far upon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the\\n      rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears.\\n      God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the\\n      firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon\\n      which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit\\n      I looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls\\n      drifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured\\n      clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in grey wreaths down\\n      the sides of the fantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the\\n      left, half hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville\\n      Hall rose above the trees. They were the only signs of human life\\n      which I could see, save only those prehistoric huts which lay\\n      thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere was there any trace\\n      of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights\\n      before.\\n\\n      As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his\\n      dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying\\n      farmhouse of Foulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and\\n      hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see\\n      how we were getting on. He insisted upon my climbing into his\\n      dog-cart, and he gave me a lift homeward. I found him much\\n      troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel. It had\\n      wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I gave him such\\n      consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen\\n      Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.\\n\\n      “By the way, Mortimer,” said I as we jolted along the rough road,\\n      “I suppose there are few people living within driving distance of\\n      this whom you do not know?”\\n\\n      “Hardly any, I think.”\\n\\n      “Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are\\n      L. L.?”\\n\\n      He thought for a few minutes.\\n\\n      “No,” said he. “There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for\\n      whom I can’t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no\\n      one whose initials are those. Wait a bit though,” he added after\\n      a pause. “There is Laura Lyons—her initials are L. L.—but she\\n      lives in Coombe Tracey.”\\n\\n      “Who is she?” I asked.\\n\\n      “She is Frankland’s daughter.”\\n\\n      “What! Old Frankland the crank?”\\n\\n      “Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching\\n      on the moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The\\n      fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side.\\n      Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she\\n      had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other\\n      reasons as well. So, between the old sinner and the young one the\\n      girl has had a pretty bad time.”\\n\\n      “How does she live?”\\n\\n      “I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be\\n      more, for his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she\\n      may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the\\n      bad. Her story got about, and several of the people here did\\n      something to enable her to earn an honest living. Stapleton did\\n      for one, and Sir Charles for another. I gave a trifle myself. It\\n      was to set her up in a typewriting business.”\\n\\n      He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to\\n      satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is\\n      no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow\\n      morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see\\n      this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal reputation, a long step will\\n      have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of\\n      mysteries. I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent,\\n      for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent\\n      I asked him casually to what type Frankland’s skull belonged, and\\n      so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive. I have\\n      not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.\\n\\n      I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous\\n      and melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just\\n      now, which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due\\n      time.\\n\\n      Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played\\n      écarté afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the\\n      library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.\\n\\n      “Well,” said I, “has this precious relation of yours departed, or\\n      is he still lurking out yonder?”\\n\\n      “I don’t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has\\n      brought nothing but trouble here! I’ve not heard of him since I\\n      left out food for him last, and that was three days ago.”\\n\\n      “Did you see him then?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.”\\n\\n      “Then he was certainly there?”\\n\\n      “So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took\\n      it.”\\n\\n      I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at\\n      Barrymore.\\n\\n      “You know that there is another man then?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.”\\n\\n      “Have you seen him?”\\n\\n      “No, sir.”\\n\\n      “How do you know of him then?”\\n\\n      “Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He’s in hiding,\\n      too, but he’s not a convict as far as I can make out. I don’t\\n      like it, Dr. Watson—I tell you straight, sir, that I don’t like\\n      it.” He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness.\\n\\n      “Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter\\n      but that of your master. I have come here with no object except\\n      to help him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don’t like.”\\n\\n      Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst\\n      or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words.\\n\\n      “It’s all these goings-on, sir,” he cried at last, waving his\\n      hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor.\\n      “There’s foul play somewhere, and there’s black villainy brewing,\\n      to that I’ll swear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry\\n      on his way back to London again!”\\n\\n      “But what is it that alarms you?”\\n\\n      “Look at Sir Charles’s death! That was bad enough, for all that\\n      the coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night.\\n      There’s not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for\\n      it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and\\n      waiting! What’s he waiting for? What does it mean? It means no\\n      good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall\\n      be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry’s new servants\\n      are ready to take over the Hall.”\\n\\n      “But about this stranger,” said I. “Can you tell me anything\\n      about him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or\\n      what he was doing?”\\n\\n      “He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing\\n      away. At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he\\n      found that he had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he\\n      was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing he could not\\n      make out.”\\n\\n      “And where did he say that he lived?”\\n\\n      “Among the old houses on the hillside—the stone huts where the\\n      old folk used to live.”\\n\\n      “But how about his food?”\\n\\n      “Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and\\n      brings all he needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what\\n      he wants.”\\n\\n      “Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other\\n      time.” When the butler had gone I walked over to the black\\n      window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds\\n      and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. It is a wild\\n      night indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor.\\n      What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in\\n      such a place at such a time! And what deep and earnest purpose\\n      can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that hut upon\\n      the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has\\n      vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have\\n      passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart\\n      of the mystery.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11.\\n\\nThe Man on the Tor\\n\\n      The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter\\n      has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time\\n      when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their\\n      terrible conclusion. The incidents of the next few days are\\n      indelibly graven upon my recollection, and I can tell them\\n      without reference to the notes made at the time. I start them\\n      from the day which succeeded that upon which I had established\\n      two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of\\n      Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an\\n      appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his\\n      death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be\\n      found among the stone huts upon the hillside. With these two\\n      facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my\\n      courage must be deficient if I could not throw some further light\\n      upon these dark places.\\n\\n      I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about\\n      Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained\\n      with him at cards until it was very late. At breakfast, however,\\n      I informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would\\n      care to accompany me to Coombe Tracey. At first he was very eager\\n      to come, but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I\\n      went alone the results might be better. The more formal we made\\n      the visit the less information we might obtain. I left Sir Henry\\n      behind, therefore, not without some prickings of conscience, and\\n      drove off upon my new quest.\\n\\n      When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses,\\n      and I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate.\\n      I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and\\n      well appointed. A maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I\\n      entered the sitting-room a lady, who was sitting before a\\n      Remington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome.\\n      Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger, and\\n      she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.\\n\\n      The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme\\n      beauty. Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and\\n      her cheeks, though considerably freckled, were flushed with the\\n      exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at\\n      the heart of the sulphur rose. Admiration was, I repeat, the\\n      first impression. But the second was criticism. There was\\n      something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of\\n      expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip\\n      which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are\\n      afterthoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in\\n      the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me\\n      the reasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that\\n      instant how delicate my mission was.\\n\\n      “I have the pleasure,” said I, “of knowing your father.”\\n\\n      It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it.\\n      “There is nothing in common between my father and me,” she said.\\n      “I owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not\\n      for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I\\n      might have starved for all that my father cared.”\\n\\n      “It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come\\n      here to see you.”\\n\\n      The freckles started out on the lady’s face.\\n\\n      “What can I tell you about him?” she asked, and her fingers\\n      played nervously over the stops of her typewriter.\\n\\n      “You knew him, did you not?”\\n\\n      “I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If\\n      I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest\\n      which he took in my unhappy situation.”\\n\\n      “Did you correspond with him?”\\n\\n      The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.\\n\\n      “What is the object of these questions?” she asked sharply.\\n\\n      “The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I\\n      should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our\\n      control.”\\n\\n      She was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she\\n      looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner.\\n\\n      “Well, I’ll answer,” she said. “What are your questions?”\\n\\n      “Did you correspond with Sir Charles?”\\n\\n      “I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his\\n      delicacy and his generosity.”\\n\\n      “Have you the dates of those letters?”\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “Have you ever met him?”\\n\\n      “Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a\\n      very retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.”\\n\\n      “But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he\\n      know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say\\n      that he has done?”\\n\\n      She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.\\n\\n      “There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united\\n      to help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate\\n      friend of Sir Charles’s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was\\n      through him that Sir Charles learned about my affairs.”\\n\\n      I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton\\n      his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady’s statement bore\\n      the impress of truth upon it.\\n\\n      “Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?” I\\n      continued.\\n\\n      Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. “Really, sir, this is a very\\n      extraordinary question.”\\n\\n      “I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.”\\n\\n      “Then I answer, certainly not.”\\n\\n      “Not on the very day of Sir Charles’s death?”\\n\\n      The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before\\n      me. Her dry lips could not speak the “No” which I saw rather than\\n      heard.\\n\\n      “Surely your memory deceives you,” said I. “I could even quote a\\n      passage of your letter. It ran ‘Please, please, as you are a\\n      gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o’clock.’”\\n\\n      I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a\\n      supreme effort.\\n\\n      “Is there no such thing as a gentleman?” she gasped.\\n\\n      “You do Sir Charles an injustice. He _did_ burn the letter. But\\n      sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned. You\\n      acknowledge now that you wrote it?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I did write it,” she cried, pouring out her soul in a\\n      torrent of words. “I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have\\n      no reason to be ashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I\\n      believed that if I had an interview I could gain his help, so I\\n      asked him to meet me.”\\n\\n      “But why at such an hour?”\\n\\n      “Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next\\n      day and might be away for months. There were reasons why I could\\n      not get there earlier.”\\n\\n      “But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the\\n      house?”\\n\\n      “Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor’s\\n      house?”\\n\\n      “Well, what happened when you did get there?”\\n\\n      “I never went.”\\n\\n      “Mrs. Lyons!”\\n\\n      “No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went.\\n      Something intervened to prevent my going.”\\n\\n      “What was that?”\\n\\n      “That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.”\\n\\n      “You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir\\n      Charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death, but\\n      you deny that you kept the appointment.”\\n\\n      “That is the truth.”\\n\\n      Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get\\n      past that point.\\n\\n      “Mrs. Lyons,” said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive\\n      interview, “you are taking a very great responsibility and\\n      putting yourself in a very false position by not making an\\n      absolutely clean breast of all that you know. If I have to call\\n      in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are\\n      compromised. If your position is innocent, why did you in the\\n      first instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that\\n      date?”\\n\\n      “Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from\\n      it and that I might find myself involved in a scandal.”\\n\\n      “And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy\\n      your letter?”\\n\\n      “If you have read the letter you will know.”\\n\\n      “I did not say that I had read all the letter.”\\n\\n      “You quoted some of it.”\\n\\n      “I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned\\n      and it was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that\\n      you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter\\n      which he received on the day of his death.”\\n\\n      “The matter is a very private one.”\\n\\n      “The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.”\\n\\n      “I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy\\n      history you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason\\n      to regret it.”\\n\\n      “I have heard so much.”\\n\\n      “My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I\\n      abhor. The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the\\n      possibility that he may force me to live with him. At the time\\n      that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there\\n      was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses\\n      could be met. It meant everything to me—peace of mind, happiness,\\n      self-respect—everything. I knew Sir Charles’s generosity, and I\\n      thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help\\n      me.”\\n\\n      “Then how is it that you did not go?”\\n\\n      “Because I received help in the interval from another source.”\\n\\n      “Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?”\\n\\n      “So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next\\n      morning.”\\n\\n      The woman’s story hung coherently together, and all my questions\\n      were unable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she\\n      had, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against her husband\\n      at or about the time of the tragedy.\\n\\n      It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been\\n      to Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be\\n      necessary to take her there, and could not have returned to\\n      Coombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning. Such an\\n      excursion could not be kept secret. The probability was,\\n      therefore, that she was telling the truth, or, at least, a part\\n      of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened. Once again I\\n      had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every\\n      path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet\\n      the more I thought of the lady’s face and of her manner the more\\n      I felt that something was being held back from me. Why should she\\n      turn so pale? Why should she fight against every admission until\\n      it was forced from her? Why should she have been so reticent at\\n      the time of the tragedy? Surely the explanation of all this could\\n      not be as innocent as she would have me believe. For the moment I\\n      could proceed no farther in that direction, but must turn back to\\n      that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts\\n      upon the moor.\\n\\n      And that was a most vague direction. I realised it as I drove\\n      back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient\\n      people. Barrymore’s only indication had been that the stranger\\n      lived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them\\n      are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor. But\\n      I had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man\\n      himself standing upon the summit of the Black Tor. That, then,\\n      should be the centre of my search. From there I should explore\\n      every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right one. If\\n      this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at\\n      the point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had\\n      dogged us so long. He might slip away from us in the crowd of\\n      Regent Street, but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely\\n      moor. On the other hand, if I should find the hut and its tenant\\n      should not be within it I must remain there, however long the\\n      vigil, until he returned. Holmes had missed him in London. It\\n      would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run him to earth\\n      where my master had failed.\\n\\n      Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now\\n      at last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was\\n      none other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, grey-whiskered\\n      and red-faced, outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to\\n      the highroad along which I travelled.\\n\\n      “Good-day, Dr. Watson,” cried he with unwonted good humour, “you\\n      must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass\\n      of wine and to congratulate me.”\\n\\n      My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after\\n      what I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was\\n      anxious to send Perkins and the wagonette home, and the\\n      opportunity was a good one. I alighted and sent a message to Sir\\n      Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner. Then I followed\\n      Frankland into his dining-room.\\n\\n      “It is a great day for me, sir—one of the red-letter days of my\\n      life,” he cried with many chuckles. “I have brought off a double\\n      event. I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and\\n      that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it. I have\\n      established a right of way through the centre of old Middleton’s\\n      park, slap across it, sir, within a hundred yards of his own\\n      front door. What do you think of that? We’ll teach these magnates\\n      that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners,\\n      confound them! And I’ve closed the wood where the Fernworthy folk\\n      used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that there\\n      are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they\\n      like with their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr.\\n      Watson, and both in my favour. I haven’t had such a day since I\\n      had Sir John Morland for trespass because he shot in his own\\n      warren.”\\n\\n      “How on earth did you do that?”\\n\\n      “Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading—Frankland\\n      _v_. Morland, Court of Queen’s Bench. It cost me £200, but I got\\n      my verdict.”\\n\\n      “Did it do you any good?”\\n\\n      “None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the\\n      matter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no\\n      doubt, for example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in\\n      effigy tonight. I told the police last time they did it that they\\n      should stop these disgraceful exhibitions. The County\\n      Constabulary is in a scandalous state, sir, and it has not\\n      afforded me the protection to which I am entitled. The case of\\n      Frankland _v_. Regina will bring the matter before the attention\\n      of the public. I told them that they would have occasion to\\n      regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come\\n      true.”\\n\\n      “How so?” I asked.\\n\\n      The old man put on a very knowing expression. “Because I could\\n      tell them what they are dying to know; but nothing would induce\\n      me to help the rascals in any way.”\\n\\n      I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get\\n      away from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it.\\n      I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to\\n      understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest\\n      way to stop his confidences.\\n\\n      “Some poaching case, no doubt?” said I with an indifferent\\n      manner.\\n\\n      “Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that!\\n      What about the convict on the moor?”\\n\\n      I stared. “You don’t mean that you know where he is?” said I.\\n\\n      “I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I\\n      could help the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never\\n      struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where\\n      he got his food and so trace it to him?”\\n\\n      He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth.\\n      “No doubt,” said I; “but how do you know that he is anywhere upon\\n      the moor?”\\n\\n      “I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who\\n      takes him his food.”\\n\\n      My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the\\n      power of this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a\\n      weight from my mind.\\n\\n      “You’ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a\\n      child. I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He\\n      passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should\\n      he be going except to the convict?”\\n\\n      Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of\\n      interest. A child! Barrymore had said that our unknown was\\n      supplied by a boy. It was on his track, and not upon the\\n      convict’s, that Frankland had stumbled. If I could get his\\n      knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But incredulity\\n      and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.\\n\\n      “I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of\\n      one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father’s dinner.”\\n\\n      The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old\\n      autocrat. His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his grey\\n      whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat.\\n\\n      “Indeed, sir!” said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching\\n      moor. “Do you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see\\n      the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it? It is the\\n      stoniest part of the whole moor. Is that a place where a shepherd\\n      would be likely to take his station? Your suggestion, sir, is a\\n      most absurd one.”\\n\\n      I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the\\n      facts. My submission pleased him and led him to further\\n      confidences.\\n\\n      “You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I\\n      come to an opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his\\n      bundle. Every day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been\\n      able—but wait a moment, Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is\\n      there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside?”\\n\\n      It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark\\n      dot against the dull green and grey.\\n\\n      “Come, sir, come!” cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. “You will\\n      see with your own eyes and judge for yourself.”\\n\\n      The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod,\\n      stood upon the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye\\n      to it and gave a cry of satisfaction.\\n\\n      “Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!”\\n\\n      There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle\\n      upon his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached\\n      the crest I saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant\\n      against the cold blue sky. He looked round him with a furtive and\\n      stealthy air, as one who dreads pursuit. Then he vanished over\\n      the hill.\\n\\n      “Well! Am I right?”\\n\\n      “Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.”\\n\\n      “And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But\\n      not one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy\\n      also, Dr. Watson. Not a word! You understand!”\\n\\n      “Just as you wish.”\\n\\n      “They have treated me shamefully—shamefully. When the facts come\\n      out in Frankland _v_. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of\\n      indignation will run through the country. Nothing would induce me\\n      to help the police in any way. For all they cared it might have\\n      been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at the\\n      stake. Surely you are not going! You will help me to empty the\\n      decanter in honour of this great occasion!”\\n\\n      But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading\\n      him from his announced intention of walking home with me. I kept\\n      the road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off\\n      across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy\\n      had disappeared. Everything was working in my favour, and I swore\\n      that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that\\n      I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way.\\n\\n      The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the\\n      hill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one\\n      side and grey shadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the\\n      farthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of\\n      Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide expanse there was no sound\\n      and no movement. One great grey bird, a gull or curlew, soared\\n      aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the only living\\n      things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath\\n      it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery\\n      and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy\\n      was nowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of the\\n      hills there was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle\\n      of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a\\n      screen against the weather. My heart leaped within me as I saw\\n      it. This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked. At last my\\n      foot was on the threshold of his hiding place—his secret was\\n      within my grasp.\\n\\n      As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do\\n      when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I\\n      satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a\\n      habitation. A vague pathway among the boulders led to the\\n      dilapidated opening which served as a door. All was silent\\n      within. The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be\\n      prowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of\\n      adventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the\\n      butt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked\\n      in. The place was empty.\\n\\n      But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false\\n      scent. This was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets\\n      rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which\\n      Neolithic man had once slumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped\\n      in a rude grate. Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket\\n      half-full of water. A litter of empty tins showed that the place\\n      had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes became\\n      accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-full\\n      bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of the\\n      hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this\\n      stood a small cloth bundle—the same, no doubt, which I had seen\\n      through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained\\n      a loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved\\n      peaches. As I set it down again, after having examined it, my\\n      heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper\\n      with writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I read,\\n      roughly scrawled in pencil: “Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe\\n      Tracey.”\\n\\n      For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking\\n      out the meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir\\n      Henry, who was being dogged by this secret man. He had not\\n      followed me himself, but he had set an agent—the boy,\\n      perhaps—upon my track, and this was his report. Possibly I had\\n      taken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not been\\n      observed and reported. Always there was this feeling of an unseen\\n      force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and\\n      delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme\\n      moment that one realised that one was indeed entangled in its\\n      meshes.\\n\\n      If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round\\n      the hut in search of them. There was no trace, however, of\\n      anything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which might\\n      indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this\\n      singular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits and cared\\n      little for the comforts of life. When I thought of the heavy\\n      rains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and\\n      immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that\\n      inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by\\n      chance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut\\n      until I knew.\\n\\n      Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with\\n      scarlet and gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches\\n      by the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There\\n      were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur\\n      of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen. Between the two,\\n      behind the hill, was the house of the Stapletons. All was sweet\\n      and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as I\\n      looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature but\\n      quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which\\n      every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves but a\\n      fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited\\n      with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.\\n\\n      And then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a\\n      boot striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming\\n      nearer and nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and\\n      cocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover myself\\n      until I had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger.\\n      There was a long pause which showed that he had stopped. Then\\n      once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the\\n      opening of the hut.\\n\\n      “It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,” said a well-known\\n      voice. “I really think that you will be more comfortable outside\\n      than in.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12.\\n\\nDeath on the Moor\\n\\n      For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my\\n      ears. Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a\\n      crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be\\n      lifted from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice could\\n      belong to but one man in all the world.\\n\\n      “Holmes!” I cried—“Holmes!”\\n\\n      “Come out,” said he, “and please be careful with the revolver.”\\n\\n      I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone\\n      outside, his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon\\n      my astonished features. He was thin and worn, but clear and\\n      alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the\\n      wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other\\n      tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that catlike\\n      love of personal cleanliness which was one of his\\n      characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen\\n      as perfect as if he were in Baker Street.\\n\\n      “I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,” said I as I\\n      wrung him by the hand.\\n\\n      “Or more astonished, eh?”\\n\\n      “Well, I must confess to it.”\\n\\n      “The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no\\n      idea that you had found my occasional retreat, still less that\\n      you were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door.”\\n\\n      “My footprint, I presume?”\\n\\n      “No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your\\n      footprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously\\n      desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I\\n      see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know\\n      that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it\\n      there beside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at that\\n      supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut.”\\n\\n      “Exactly.”\\n\\n      “I thought as much—and knowing your admirable tenacity I was\\n      convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach,\\n      waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that I\\n      was the criminal?”\\n\\n      “I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.”\\n\\n      “Excellent, Watson! And how did you localise me? You saw me,\\n      perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so\\n      imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I saw you then.”\\n\\n      “And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this\\n      one?”\\n\\n      “No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where\\n      to look.”\\n\\n      “The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make\\n      it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.” He\\n      rose and peeped into the hut. “Ha, I see that Cartwright has\\n      brought up some supplies. What’s this paper? So you have been to\\n      Coombe Tracey, have you?”\\n\\n      “Yes.”\\n\\n      “To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?”\\n\\n      “Exactly.”\\n\\n      “Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on\\n      parallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall\\n      have a fairly full knowledge of the case.”\\n\\n      “Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the\\n      responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my\\n      nerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what\\n      have you been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street\\n      working out that case of blackmailing.”\\n\\n      “That was what I wished you to think.”\\n\\n      “Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!” I cried with some\\n      bitterness. “I think that I have deserved better at your hands,\\n      Holmes.”\\n\\n      “My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in\\n      many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have\\n      seemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your\\n      own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger\\n      which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter\\n      for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident\\n      that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my\\n      presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on\\n      their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I could\\n      not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I\\n      remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all\\n      my weight at a critical moment.”\\n\\n      “But why keep me in the dark?”\\n\\n      “For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have\\n      led to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something,\\n      or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or\\n      other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run. I brought\\n      Cartwright down with me—you remember the little chap at the\\n      express office—and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of\\n      bread and a clean collar. What does man want more? He has given\\n      me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet, and\\n      both have been invaluable.”\\n\\n      “Then my reports have all been wasted!”—My voice trembled as I\\n      recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.\\n\\n      Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.\\n\\n      “Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I\\n      assure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only\\n      delayed one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly\\n      upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an\\n      extraordinarily difficult case.”\\n\\n      I was still rather raw over the deception which had been\\n      practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes’s praise drove my\\n      anger from my mind. I felt also in my heart that he was right in\\n      what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I\\n      should not have known that he was upon the moor.\\n\\n      “That’s better,” said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face.\\n      “And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons—it\\n      was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you\\n      had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person in\\n      Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter. In\\n      fact, if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that I\\n      should have gone tomorrow.”\\n\\n      The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had\\n      turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There,\\n      sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my\\n      conversation with the lady. So interested was he that I had to\\n      repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied.\\n\\n      “This is most important,” said he when I had concluded. “It fills\\n      up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex\\n      affair. You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists\\n      between this lady and the man Stapleton?”\\n\\n      “I did not know of a close intimacy.”\\n\\n      “There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write,\\n      there is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a\\n      very powerful weapon into our hands. If I could only use it to\\n      detach his wife—”\\n\\n      “His wife?”\\n\\n      “I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you\\n      have given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is\\n      in reality his wife.”\\n\\n      “Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he\\n      have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?”\\n\\n      “Sir Henry’s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except\\n      Sir Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make\\n      love to her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the\\n      lady is his wife and not his sister.”\\n\\n      “But why this elaborate deception?”\\n\\n      “Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to\\n      him in the character of a free woman.”\\n\\n      All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took\\n      shape and centred upon the naturalist. In that impassive\\n      colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I\\n      seemed to see something terrible—a creature of infinite patience\\n      and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart.\\n\\n      “It is he, then, who is our enemy—it is he who dogged us in\\n      London?”\\n\\n      “So I read the riddle.”\\n\\n      “And the warning—it must have come from her!”\\n\\n      “Exactly.”\\n\\n      The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed,\\n      loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long.\\n\\n      “But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman\\n      is his wife?”\\n\\n      “Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of\\n      autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare\\n      say he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a\\n      schoolmaster in the north of England. Now, there is no one more\\n      easy to trace than a schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies\\n      by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession.\\n      A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief\\n      under atrocious circumstances, and that the man who had owned\\n      it—the name was different—had disappeared with his wife. The\\n      descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man was\\n      devoted to entomology the identification was complete.”\\n\\n      The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the\\n      shadows.\\n\\n      “If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons\\n      come in?” I asked.\\n\\n      “That is one of the points upon which your own researches have\\n      shed a light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the\\n      situation very much. I did not know about a projected divorce\\n      between herself and her husband. In that case, regarding\\n      Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming\\n      his wife.”\\n\\n      “And when she is undeceived?”\\n\\n      “Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first\\n      duty to see her—both of us—tomorrow. Don’t you think, Watson,\\n      that you are away from your charge rather long? Your place should\\n      be at Baskerville Hall.”\\n\\n      The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had\\n      settled upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a\\n      violet sky.\\n\\n      “One last question, Holmes,” I said as I rose. “Surely there is\\n      no need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it\\n      all? What is he after?”\\n\\n      Holmes’s voice sank as he answered:\\n\\n      “It is murder, Watson—refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder.\\n      Do not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even\\n      as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already\\n      almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten\\n      us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so.\\n      Another day—two at the most—and I have my case complete, but\\n      until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother\\n      watched her ailing child. Your mission today has justified\\n      itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his\\n      side. Hark!”\\n\\n      A terrible scream—a prolonged yell of horror and anguish—burst\\n      out of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the\\n      blood to ice in my veins.\\n\\n      “Oh, my God!” I gasped. “What is it? What does it mean?”\\n\\n      Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic\\n      outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head\\n      thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.\\n\\n      “Hush!” he whispered. “Hush!”\\n\\n      The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had\\n      pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it\\n      burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.\\n\\n      “Where is it?” Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of\\n      his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.\\n      “Where is it, Watson?”\\n\\n      “There, I think.” I pointed into the darkness.\\n\\n      “No, there!”\\n\\n      Again the agonised cry swept through the silent night, louder and\\n      much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep,\\n      muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling\\n      like the low, constant murmur of the sea.\\n\\n      “The hound!” cried Holmes. “Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if\\n      we are too late!”\\n\\n      He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed\\n      at his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground\\n      immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell,\\n      and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not another\\n      sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.\\n\\n      I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted.\\n      He stamped his feet upon the ground.\\n\\n      “He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.”\\n\\n      “No, no, surely not!”\\n\\n      “Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes\\n      of abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has\\n      happened we’ll avenge him!”\\n\\n      Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders,\\n      forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and\\n      rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those\\n      dreadful sounds had come. At every rise Holmes looked eagerly\\n      round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing\\n      moved upon its dreary face.\\n\\n      “Can you see anything?”\\n\\n      “Nothing.”\\n\\n      “But, hark, what is that?”\\n\\n      A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our\\n      left! On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which\\n      overlooked a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was\\n      spread-eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran towards it\\n      the vague outline hardened into a definite shape. It was a\\n      prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled\\n      under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body\\n      hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. So\\n      grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant\\n      realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a\\n      whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which\\n      we stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again\\n      with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which he\\n      struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool\\n      which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. And it\\n      shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint\\n      within us—the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!\\n\\n      There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar\\n      ruddy tweed suit—the very one which he had worn on the first\\n      morning that we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one\\n      clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out,\\n      even as the hope had gone out of our souls. Holmes groaned, and\\n      his face glimmered white through the darkness.\\n\\n      “The brute! The brute!” I cried with clenched hands. “Oh Holmes,\\n      I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.”\\n\\n      “I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case\\n      well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my\\n      client. It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my\\n      career. But how could I know—how _could_ I know—that he would\\n      risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my\\n      warnings?”\\n\\n      “That we should have heard his screams—my God, those screams!—and\\n      yet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound\\n      which drove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks\\n      at this instant. And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for\\n      this deed.”\\n\\n      “He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been\\n      murdered—the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast\\n      which he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his end\\n      in his wild flight to escape from it. But now we have to prove\\n      the connection between the man and the beast. Save from what we\\n      heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, since\\n      Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. But, by heavens,\\n      cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before another\\n      day is past!”\\n\\n      We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,\\n      overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had\\n      brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then\\n      as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which\\n      our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over\\n      the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away, miles\\n      off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light\\n      was shining. It could only come from the lonely abode of the\\n      Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed.\\n\\n      “Why should we not seize him at once?”\\n\\n      “Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the\\n      last degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we\\n      make one false move the villain may escape us yet.”\\n\\n      “What can we do?”\\n\\n      “There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only\\n      perform the last offices to our poor friend.”\\n\\n      Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and\\n      approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones.\\n      The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain\\n      and blurred my eyes with tears.\\n\\n      “We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way\\n      to the Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?”\\n\\n      He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing\\n      and laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern,\\n      self-contained friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!\\n\\n      “A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!”\\n\\n      “A beard?”\\n\\n      “It is not the baronet—it is—why, it is my neighbour, the\\n      convict!”\\n\\n      With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that\\n      dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There\\n      could be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal\\n      eyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the\\n      light of the candle from over the rock—the face of Selden, the\\n      criminal.\\n\\n      Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the\\n      baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to\\n      Barrymore. Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden in\\n      his escape. Boots, shirt, cap—it was all Sir Henry’s. The tragedy\\n      was still black enough, but this man had at least deserved death\\n      by the laws of his country. I told Holmes how the matter stood,\\n      my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.\\n\\n      “Then the clothes have been the poor devil’s death,” said he. “It\\n      is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article\\n      of Sir Henry’s—the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all\\n      probability—and so ran this man down. There is one very singular\\n      thing, however: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that\\n      the hound was on his trail?”\\n\\n      “He heard him.”\\n\\n      “To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like\\n      this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk\\n      recapture by screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have\\n      run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track. How did\\n      he know?”\\n\\n      “A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all\\n      our conjectures are correct—”\\n\\n      “I presume nothing.”\\n\\n      “Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose\\n      that it does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would\\n      not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would\\n      be there.”\\n\\n      “My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think\\n      that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while\\n      mine may remain forever a mystery. The question now is, what\\n      shall we do with this poor wretch’s body? We cannot leave it here\\n      to the foxes and the ravens.”\\n\\n      “I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can\\n      communicate with the police.”\\n\\n      “Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far.\\n      Halloa, Watson, what’s this? It’s the man himself, by all that’s\\n      wonderful and audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions—not a\\n      word, or my plans crumble to the ground.”\\n\\n      A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red\\n      glow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish\\n      the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped\\n      when he saw us, and then came on again.\\n\\n      “Why, Dr. Watson, that’s not you, is it? You are the last man\\n      that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time\\n      of night. But, dear me, what’s this? Somebody hurt? Not—don’t\\n      tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!” He hurried past me and\\n      stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath\\n      and the cigar fell from his fingers.\\n\\n      “Who—who’s this?” he stammered.\\n\\n      “It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.”\\n\\n      Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort\\n      he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked\\n      sharply from Holmes to me. “Dear me! What a very shocking affair!\\n      How did he die?”\\n\\n      “He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks.\\n      My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.”\\n\\n      “I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy\\n      about Sir Henry.”\\n\\n      “Why about Sir Henry in particular?” I could not help asking.\\n\\n      “Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did\\n      not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his\\n      safety when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way”—his eyes\\n      darted again from my face to Holmes’s—“did you hear anything else\\n      besides a cry?”\\n\\n      “No,” said Holmes; “did you?”\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “What do you mean, then?”\\n\\n      “Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom\\n      hound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor.\\n      I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound\\n      tonight.”\\n\\n      “We heard nothing of the kind,” said I.\\n\\n      “And what is your theory of this poor fellow’s death?”\\n\\n      “I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off\\n      his head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and\\n      eventually fallen over here and broken his neck.”\\n\\n      “That seems the most reasonable theory,” said Stapleton, and he\\n      gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. “What do you\\n      think about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”\\n\\n      My friend bowed his compliments. “You are quick at\\n      identification,” said he.\\n\\n      “We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came\\n      down. You are in time to see a tragedy.”\\n\\n      “Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend’s explanation will\\n      cover the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to\\n      London with me tomorrow.”\\n\\n      “Oh, you return tomorrow?”\\n\\n      “That is my intention.”\\n\\n      “I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences\\n      which have puzzled us?”\\n\\n      Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n      “One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An\\n      investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not\\n      been a satisfactory case.”\\n\\n      My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner.\\n      Stapleton still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.\\n\\n      “I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it\\n      would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified\\n      in doing it. I think that if we put something over his face he\\n      will be safe until morning.”\\n\\n      And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton’s offer of\\n      hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving\\n      the naturalist to return alone. Looking back we saw the figure\\n      moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one\\n      black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was\\n      lying who had come so horribly to his end.\\n\\n      “We’re at close grips at last,” said Holmes as we walked together\\n      across the moor. “What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled\\n      himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing\\n      shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his\\n      plot. I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again,\\n      that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.”\\n\\n      “I am sorry that he has seen you.”\\n\\n      “And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.”\\n\\n      “What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he\\n      knows you are here?”\\n\\n      “It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to\\n      desperate measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be\\n      too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has\\n      completely deceived us.”\\n\\n      “Why should we not arrest him at once?”\\n\\n      “My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your\\n      instinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for\\n      argument’s sake, that we had him arrested tonight, what on earth\\n      the better off should we be for that? We could prove nothing\\n      against him. There’s the devilish cunning of it! If he were\\n      acting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but if\\n      we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not\\n      help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.”\\n\\n      “Surely we have a case.”\\n\\n      “Not a shadow of one—only surmise and conjecture. We should be\\n      laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such\\n      evidence.”\\n\\n      “There is Sir Charles’s death.”\\n\\n      “Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died\\n      of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how\\n      are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are\\n      there of a hound? Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course we\\n      know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles\\n      was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we have to prove\\n      all this, and we are not in a position to do it.”\\n\\n      “Well, then, tonight?”\\n\\n      “We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct\\n      connection between the hound and the man’s death. We never saw\\n      the hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was\\n      running upon this man’s trail. There is a complete absence of\\n      motive. No, my dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves to the\\n      fact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth our\\n      while to run any risk in order to establish one.”\\n\\n      “And how do you propose to do so?”\\n\\n      “I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when\\n      the position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own\\n      plan as well. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I\\n      hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last.”\\n\\n      I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in\\n      thought, as far as the Baskerville gates.\\n\\n      “Are you coming up?”\\n\\n      “Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,\\n      Watson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that\\n      Selden’s death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will\\n      have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo\\n      tomorrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright,\\n      to dine with these people.”\\n\\n      “And so am I.”\\n\\n      “Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be\\n      easily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think\\n      that we are both ready for our suppers.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13.\\n\\nFixing the Nets\\n\\n      Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes,\\n      for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would\\n      bring him down from London. He did raise his eyebrows, however,\\n      when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any\\n      explanations for its absence. Between us we soon supplied his\\n      wants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet\\n      as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should\\n      know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to\\n      Barrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an unmitigated\\n      relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world he\\n      was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her\\n      he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the\\n      child who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has\\n      not one woman to mourn him.\\n\\n      “I’ve been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in\\n      the morning,” said the baronet. “I guess I should have some\\n      credit, for I have kept my promise. If I hadn’t sworn not to go\\n      about alone I might have had a more lively evening, for I had a\\n      message from Stapleton asking me over there.”\\n\\n      “I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,”\\n      said Holmes drily. “By the way, I don’t suppose you appreciate\\n      that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck?”\\n\\n      Sir Henry opened his eyes. “How was that?”\\n\\n      “This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your\\n      servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the\\n      police.”\\n\\n      “That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I\\n      know.”\\n\\n      “That’s lucky for him—in fact, it’s lucky for all of you, since\\n      you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not\\n      sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to\\n      arrest the whole household. Watson’s reports are most\\n      incriminating documents.”\\n\\n      “But how about the case?” asked the baronet. “Have you made\\n      anything out of the tangle? I don’t know that Watson and I are\\n      much the wiser since we came down.”\\n\\n      “I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation\\n      rather more clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly\\n      difficult and most complicated business. There are several points\\n      upon which we still want light—but it is coming all the same.”\\n\\n      “We’ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We\\n      heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all\\n      empty superstition. I had something to do with dogs when I was\\n      out West, and I know one when I hear one. If you can muzzle that\\n      one and put him on a chain I’ll be ready to swear you are the\\n      greatest detective of all time.”\\n\\n      “I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will\\n      give me your help.”\\n\\n      “Whatever you tell me to do I will do.”\\n\\n      “Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without\\n      always asking the reason.”\\n\\n      “Just as you like.”\\n\\n      “If you will do this I think the chances are that our little\\n      problem will soon be solved. I have no doubt—”\\n\\n      He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the\\n      air. The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so\\n      still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical\\n      statue, a personification of alertness and expectation.\\n\\n      “What is it?” we both cried.\\n\\n      I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some\\n      internal emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes\\n      shone with amused exultation.\\n\\n      “Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,” said he as he waved his\\n      hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite\\n      wall. “Watson won’t allow that I know anything of art but that is\\n      mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ. Now,\\n      these are a really very fine series of portraits.”\\n\\n      “Well, I’m glad to hear you say so,” said Sir Henry, glancing\\n      with some surprise at my friend. “I don’t pretend to know much\\n      about these things, and I’d be a better judge of a horse or a\\n      steer than of a picture. I didn’t know that you found time for\\n      such things.”\\n\\n      “I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That’s a\\n      Kneller, I’ll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and\\n      the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are\\n      all family portraits, I presume?”\\n\\n      “Every one.”\\n\\n      “Do you know the names?”\\n\\n      “Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my\\n      lessons fairly well.”\\n\\n      “Who is the gentleman with the telescope?”\\n\\n      “That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the\\n      West Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is\\n      Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the\\n      House of Commons under Pitt.”\\n\\n      “And this Cavalier opposite to me—the one with the black velvet\\n      and the lace?”\\n\\n      “Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all\\n      the mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the\\n      Baskervilles. We’re not likely to forget him.”\\n\\n      I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.\\n\\n      “Dear me!” said Holmes, “he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man\\n      enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his\\n      eyes. I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.”\\n\\n      “There’s no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the\\n      date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas.”\\n\\n      Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer\\n      seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were\\n      continually fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later,\\n      when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow\\n      the trend of his thoughts. He led me back into the\\n      banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it\\n      up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.\\n\\n      “Do you see anything there?”\\n\\n      I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the\\n      white lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed\\n      between them. It was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim,\\n      hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly\\n      intolerant eye.\\n\\n      “Is it like anyone you know?”\\n\\n      “There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.”\\n\\n      “Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!” He stood upon\\n      a chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved\\n      his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.\\n\\n      “Good heavens!” I cried in amazement.\\n\\n      The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.\\n\\n      “Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces\\n      and not their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal\\n      investigator that he should see through a disguise.”\\n\\n      “But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.”\\n\\n      “Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears\\n      to be both physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is\\n      enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The\\n      fellow is a Baskerville—that is evident.”\\n\\n      “With designs upon the succession.”\\n\\n      “Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of\\n      our most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him,\\n      and I dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering\\n      in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a\\n      cork, and a card, and we add him to the Baker Street collection!”\\n      He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away\\n      from the picture. I have not heard him laugh often, and it has\\n      always boded ill to somebody.\\n\\n      I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier\\n      still, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.\\n\\n      “Yes, we should have a full day today,” he remarked, and he\\n      rubbed his hands with the joy of action. “The nets are all in\\n      place, and the drag is about to begin. We’ll know before the day\\n      is out whether we have caught our big, lean-jawed pike, or\\n      whether he has got through the meshes.”\\n\\n      “Have you been on the moor already?”\\n\\n      “I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death\\n      of Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be\\n      troubled in the matter. And I have also communicated with my\\n      faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the\\n      door of my hut, as a dog does at his master’s grave, if I had not\\n      set his mind at rest about my safety.”\\n\\n      “What is the next move?”\\n\\n      “To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!”\\n\\n      “Good-morning, Holmes,” said the baronet. “You look like a\\n      general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.”\\n\\n      “That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.”\\n\\n      “And so do I.”\\n\\n      “Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our\\n      friends the Stapletons tonight.”\\n\\n      “I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people,\\n      and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you.”\\n\\n      “I fear that Watson and I must go to London.”\\n\\n      “To London?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present\\n      juncture.”\\n\\n      The baronet’s face perceptibly lengthened.\\n\\n      “I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The\\n      Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is\\n      alone.”\\n\\n      “My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what\\n      I tell you. You can tell your friends that we should have been\\n      happy to have come with you, but that urgent business required us\\n      to be in town. We hope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will\\n      you remember to give them that message?”\\n\\n      “If you insist upon it.”\\n\\n      “There is no alternative, I assure you.”\\n\\n      I saw by the baronet’s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by\\n      what he regarded as our desertion.\\n\\n      “When do you desire to go?” he asked coldly.\\n\\n      “Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey,\\n      but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come\\n      back to you. Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell\\n      him that you regret that you cannot come.”\\n\\n      “I have a good mind to go to London with you,” said the baronet.\\n      “Why should I stay here alone?”\\n\\n      “Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word\\n      that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.”\\n\\n      “All right, then, I’ll stay.”\\n\\n      “One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send\\n      back your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to\\n      walk home.”\\n\\n      “To walk across the moor?”\\n\\n      “Yes.”\\n\\n      “But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me\\n      not to do.”\\n\\n      “This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every\\n      confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but\\n      it is essential that you should do it.”\\n\\n      “Then I will do it.”\\n\\n      “And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any\\n      direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit\\n      House to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.”\\n\\n      “I will do just what you say.”\\n\\n      “Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast\\n      as possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.”\\n\\n      I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that\\n      Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit\\n      would terminate next day. It had not crossed my mind however,\\n      that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand how\\n      we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to\\n      be critical. There was nothing for it, however, but implicit\\n      obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend, and a couple\\n      of hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey and\\n      had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A small boy was\\n      waiting upon the platform.\\n\\n      “Any orders, sir?”\\n\\n      “You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you\\n      arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name,\\n      to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is\\n      to send it by registered post to Baker Street.”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.”\\n\\n      The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It\\n      ran:\\n\\n      Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive\\n      five-forty. Lestrade.\\n\\n      “That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the\\n      professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now,\\n      Watson, I think that we cannot employ our time better than by\\n      calling upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.”\\n\\n      His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use\\n      the baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were\\n      really gone, while we should actually return at the instant when\\n      we were likely to be needed. That telegram from London, if\\n      mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons, must remove the last\\n      suspicions from their minds. Already I seemed to see our nets\\n      drawing closer around that lean-jawed pike.\\n\\n      Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened\\n      his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably\\n      amazed her.\\n\\n      “I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of\\n      the late Sir Charles Baskerville,” said he. “My friend here, Dr.\\n      Watson, has informed me of what you have communicated, and also\\n      of what you have withheld in connection with that matter.”\\n\\n      “What have I withheld?” she asked defiantly.\\n\\n      “You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate\\n      at ten o’clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his\\n      death. You have withheld what the connection is between these\\n      events.”\\n\\n      “There is no connection.”\\n\\n      “In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary\\n      one. But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a\\n      connection, after all. I wish to be perfectly frank with you,\\n      Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as one of murder, and the\\n      evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but his\\n      wife as well.”\\n\\n      The lady sprang from her chair.\\n\\n      “His wife!” she cried.\\n\\n      “The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for\\n      his sister is really his wife.”\\n\\n      Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms\\n      of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with\\n      the pressure of her grip.\\n\\n      “His wife!” she said again. “His wife! He is not a married man.”\\n\\n      Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n      “Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so—!”\\n\\n      The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.\\n\\n      “I have come prepared to do so,” said Holmes, drawing several\\n      papers from his pocket. “Here is a photograph of the couple taken\\n      in York four years ago. It is indorsed ‘Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,’\\n      but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also,\\n      if you know her by sight. Here are three written descriptions by\\n      trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time\\n      kept St. Oliver’s private school. Read them and see if you can\\n      doubt the identity of these people.”\\n\\n      She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid\\n      face of a desperate woman.\\n\\n      “Mr. Holmes,” she said, “this man had offered me marriage on\\n      condition that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied\\n      to me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of\\n      truth has he ever told me. And why—why? I imagined that all was\\n      for my own sake. But now I see that I was never anything but a\\n      tool in his hands. Why should I preserve faith with him who never\\n      kept any with me? Why should I try to shield him from the\\n      consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you like, and\\n      there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear to\\n      you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of\\n      any harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.”\\n\\n      “I entirely believe you, madam,” said Sherlock Holmes. “The\\n      recital of these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps\\n      it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can\\n      check me if I make any material mistake. The sending of this\\n      letter was suggested to you by Stapleton?”\\n\\n      “He dictated it.”\\n\\n      “I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive\\n      help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your\\n      divorce?”\\n\\n      “Exactly.”\\n\\n      “And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from\\n      keeping the appointment?”\\n\\n      “He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other\\n      man should find the money for such an object, and that though he\\n      was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing\\n      the obstacles which divided us.”\\n\\n      “He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard\\n      nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?”\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with\\n      Sir Charles?”\\n\\n      “He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and\\n      that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He\\n      frightened me into remaining silent.”\\n\\n      “Quite so. But you had your suspicions?”\\n\\n      She hesitated and looked down.\\n\\n      “I knew him,” she said. “But if he had kept faith with me I\\n      should always have done so with him.”\\n\\n      “I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,” said\\n      Sherlock Holmes. “You have had him in your power and he knew it,\\n      and yet you are alive. You have been walking for some months very\\n      near to the edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning\\n      now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortly\\n      hear from us again.”\\n\\n      “Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty\\n      thins away in front of us,” said Holmes as we stood waiting for\\n      the arrival of the express from town. “I shall soon be in the\\n      position of being able to put into a single connected narrative\\n      one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times.\\n      Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in\\n      Godno, in Little Russia, in the year ’66, and of course there are\\n      the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possesses\\n      some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no\\n      clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much\\n      surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this\\n      night.”\\n\\n      The London express came roaring into the station, and a small,\\n      wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We\\n      all three shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way\\n      in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a\\n      good deal since the days when they had first worked together. I\\n      could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner\\n      used then to excite in the practical man.\\n\\n      “Anything good?” he asked.\\n\\n      “The biggest thing for years,” said Holmes. “We have two hours\\n      before we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in\\n      getting some dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London\\n      fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night\\n      air of Dartmoor. Never been there? Ah, well, I don’t suppose you\\n      will forget your first visit.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14.\\n\\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\\n\\n      One of Sherlock Holmes’s defects—if, indeed, one may call it a\\n      defect—was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full\\n      plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment.\\n      Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which\\n      loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partly\\n      also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take\\n      any chances. The result, however, was very trying for those who\\n      were acting as his agents and assistants. I had often suffered\\n      under it, but never more so than during that long drive in the\\n      darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were\\n      about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,\\n      and I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My\\n      nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon\\n      our faces and the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow\\n      road told me that we were back upon the moor once again. Every\\n      stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us\\n      nearer to our supreme adventure.\\n\\n      Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of\\n      the hired wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial\\n      matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation.\\n      It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint, when we at\\n      last passed Frankland’s house and knew that we were drawing near\\n      to the Hall and to the scene of action. We did not drive up to\\n      the door but got down near the gate of the avenue. The wagonette\\n      was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith,\\n      while we started to walk to Merripit House.\\n\\n      “Are you armed, Lestrade?”\\n\\n      The little detective smiled. “As long as I have my trousers I\\n      have a hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have\\n      something in it.”\\n\\n      “Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.”\\n\\n      “You’re mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What’s the\\n      game now?”\\n\\n      “A waiting game.”\\n\\n      “My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,” said the\\n      detective with a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes\\n      of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the\\n      Grimpen Mire. “I see the lights of a house ahead of us.”\\n\\n      “That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must\\n      request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.”\\n\\n      We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the\\n      house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards\\n      from it.\\n\\n      “This will do,” said he. “These rocks upon the right make an\\n      admirable screen.”\\n\\n      “We are to wait here?”\\n\\n      “Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,\\n      Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson?\\n      Can you tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed\\n      windows at this end?”\\n\\n      “I think they are the kitchen windows.”\\n\\n      “And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?”\\n\\n      “That is certainly the dining-room.”\\n\\n      “The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep\\n      forward quietly and see what they are doing—but for heaven’s sake\\n      don’t let them know that they are watched!”\\n\\n      I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which\\n      surrounded the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached\\n      a point whence I could look straight through the uncurtained\\n      window.\\n\\n      There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton.\\n      They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the\\n      round table. Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and\\n      wine were in front of them. Stapleton was talking with animation,\\n      but the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought of\\n      that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily\\n      upon his mind.\\n\\n      As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir\\n      Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair,\\n      puffing at his cigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp\\n      sound of boots upon gravel. The steps passed along the path on\\n      the other side of the wall under which I crouched. Looking over,\\n      I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out-house in the\\n      corner of the orchard. A key turned in a lock, and as he passed\\n      in there was a curious scuffling noise from within. He was only a\\n      minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn once more and\\n      he passed me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his guest,\\n      and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to\\n      tell them what I had seen.\\n\\n      “You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?” Holmes asked when\\n      I had finished my report.\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other\\n      room except the kitchen?”\\n\\n      “I cannot think where she is.”\\n\\n      I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense,\\n      white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked\\n      itself up like a wall on that side of us, low but thick and well\\n      defined. The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great\\n      shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks\\n      borne upon its surface. Holmes’s face was turned towards it, and\\n      he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.\\n\\n      “It’s moving towards us, Watson.”\\n\\n      “Is that serious?”\\n\\n      “Very serious, indeed—the one thing upon earth which could have\\n      disarranged my plans. He can’t be very long, now. It is already\\n      ten o’clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his\\n      coming out before the fog is over the path.”\\n\\n      The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and\\n      bright, while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft,\\n      uncertain light. Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its\\n      serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the\\n      silver-spangled sky. Broad bars of golden light from the lower\\n      windows stretched across the orchard and the moor. One of them\\n      was suddenly shut off. The servants had left the kitchen. There\\n      only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men, the\\n      murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted over\\n      their cigars.\\n\\n      Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of\\n      the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the\\n      first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of\\n      the lighted window. The farther wall of the orchard was already\\n      invisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white\\n      vapour. As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both\\n      corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on\\n      which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship\\n      upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the\\n      rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience.\\n\\n      “If he isn’t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be\\n      covered. In half an hour we won’t be able to see our hands in\\n      front of us.”\\n\\n      “Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I think it would be as well.”\\n\\n      So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we\\n      were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea,\\n      with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and\\n      inexorably on.\\n\\n      “We are going too far,” said Holmes. “We dare not take the chance\\n      of his being overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs we\\n      must hold our ground where we are.” He dropped on his knees and\\n      clapped his ear to the ground. “Thank God, I think that I hear\\n      him coming.”\\n\\n      A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching\\n      among the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in\\n      front of us. The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as\\n      through a curtain, there stepped the man whom we were awaiting.\\n      He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear,\\n      starlit night. Then he came swiftly along the path, passed close\\n      to where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us. As he\\n      walked he glanced continually over either shoulder, like a man\\n      who is ill at ease.\\n\\n      “Hist!” cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking\\n      pistol. “Look out! It’s coming!”\\n\\n      There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the\\n      heart of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of\\n      where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what\\n      horror was about to break from the heart of it. I was at Holmes’s\\n      elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale and\\n      exultant, his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight. But\\n      suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his\\n      lips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade gave a\\n      yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground. I\\n      sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind\\n      paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from\\n      the shadows of the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black\\n      hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire\\n      burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering\\n      glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in\\n      flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of a disordered\\n      brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more hellish be\\n      conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us\\n      out of the wall of fog.\\n\\n      With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the\\n      track, following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So\\n      paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass\\n      before we had recovered our nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired\\n      together, and the creature gave a hideous howl, which showed that\\n      one at least had hit him. He did not pause, however, but bounded\\n      onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back, his\\n      face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in horror, glaring\\n      helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down. But\\n      that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the\\n      winds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound\\n      him we could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran\\n      that night. I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as\\n      much as I outpaced the little professional. In front of us as we\\n      flew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and\\n      the deep roar of the hound. I was in time to see the beast spring\\n      upon its victim, hurl him to the ground, and worry at his throat.\\n      But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his\\n      revolver into the creature’s flank. With a last howl of agony and\\n      a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet\\n      pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped,\\n      panting, and pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head,\\n      but it was useless to press the trigger. The giant hound was\\n      dead.\\n\\n      Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his\\n      collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw\\n      that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in\\n      time. Already our friend’s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble\\n      effort to move. Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the\\n      baronet’s teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.\\n\\n      “My God!” he whispered. “What was it? What, in heaven’s name, was\\n      it?”\\n\\n      “It’s dead, whatever it is,” said Holmes. “We’ve laid the family\\n      ghost once and forever.”\\n\\n      In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was\\n      lying stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it\\n      was not a pure mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of\\n      the two—gaunt, savage, and as large as a small lioness. Even now\\n      in the stillness of death, the huge jaws seemed to be dripping\\n      with a bluish flame and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were\\n      ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle, and\\n      as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the\\n      darkness.\\n\\n      “Phosphorus,” I said.\\n\\n      “A cunning preparation of it,” said Holmes, sniffing at the dead\\n      animal. “There is no smell which might have interfered with his\\n      power of scent. We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having\\n      exposed you to this fright. I was prepared for a hound, but not\\n      for such a creature as this. And the fog gave us little time to\\n      receive him.”\\n\\n      “You have saved my life.”\\n\\n      “Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?”\\n\\n      “Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for\\n      anything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to\\n      do?”\\n\\n      “To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures\\n      tonight. If you will wait, one or other of us will go back with\\n      you to the Hall.”\\n\\n      He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale\\n      and trembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he\\n      sat shivering with his face buried in his hands.\\n\\n      “We must leave you now,” said Holmes. “The rest of our work must\\n      be done, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and\\n      now we only want our man.\\n\\n      “It’s a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,” he\\n      continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. “Those\\n      shots must have told him that the game was up.”\\n\\n      “We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.”\\n\\n      “He followed the hound to call him off—of that you may be\\n      certain. No, no, he’s gone by this time! But we’ll search the\\n      house and make sure.”\\n\\n      The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to\\n      room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us\\n      in the passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but\\n      Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house\\n      unexplored. No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing.\\n      On the upper floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was locked.\\n\\n      “There’s someone in here,” cried Lestrade. “I can hear a\\n      movement. Open this door!”\\n\\n      A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the\\n      door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew\\n      open. Pistol in hand, we all three rushed into the room.\\n\\n      But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant\\n      villain whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an\\n      object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment\\n      staring at it in amazement.\\n\\n      The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls\\n      were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that\\n      collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had\\n      been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man. In the\\n      centre of this room there was an upright beam, which had been\\n      placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk\\n      of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a figure was tied,\\n      so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to\\n      secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was\\n      that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and\\n      was secured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower\\n      part of the face, and over it two dark eyes—eyes full of grief\\n      and shame and a dreadful questioning—stared back at us. In a\\n      minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs.\\n      Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. As her beautiful\\n      head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash\\n      across her neck.\\n\\n      “The brute!” cried Holmes. “Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle!\\n      Put her in the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and\\n      exhaustion.”\\n\\n      She opened her eyes again.\\n\\n      “Is he safe?” she asked. “Has he escaped?”\\n\\n      “He cannot escape us, madam.”\\n\\n      “No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?”\\n\\n      “Yes.”\\n\\n      “And the hound?”\\n\\n      “It is dead.”\\n\\n      She gave a long sigh of satisfaction.\\n\\n      “Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated\\n      me!” She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with\\n      horror that they were all mottled with bruises. “But this is\\n      nothing—nothing! It is my mind and soul that he has tortured and\\n      defiled. I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of\\n      deception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the hope\\n      that I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have been\\n      his dupe and his tool.” She broke into passionate sobbing as she\\n      spoke.\\n\\n      “You bear him no good will, madam,” said Holmes. “Tell us then\\n      where we shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help\\n      us now and so atone.”\\n\\n      “There is but one place where he can have fled,” she answered.\\n      “There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire.\\n      It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made\\n      preparations so that he might have a refuge. That is where he\\n      would fly.”\\n\\n      The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held\\n      the lamp towards it.\\n\\n      “See,” said he. “No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire\\n      tonight.”\\n\\n      She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed\\n      with fierce merriment.\\n\\n      “He may find his way in, but never out,” she cried. “How can he\\n      see the guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and\\n      I, to mark the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have\\n      plucked them out today. Then indeed you would have had him at\\n      your mercy!”\\n\\n      It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog\\n      had lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house\\n      while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville\\n      Hall. The story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld\\n      from him, but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth\\n      about the woman whom he had loved. But the shock of the night’s\\n      adventures had shattered his nerves, and before morning he lay\\n      delirious in a high fever under the care of Dr. Mortimer. The two\\n      of them were destined to travel together round the world before\\n      Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he had\\n      been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.\\n\\n      And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular\\n      narrative, in which I have tried to make the reader share those\\n      dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and\\n      ended in so tragic a manner. On the morning after the death of\\n      the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton\\n      to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog. It\\n      helped us to realise the horror of this woman’s life when we saw\\n      the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband’s\\n      track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm,\\n      peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the\\n      end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the\\n      path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those\\n      green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the\\n      stranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour\\n      of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces, while a\\n      false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark,\\n      quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around\\n      our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked,\\n      and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was\\n      tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful\\n      was the clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that\\n      someone had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft\\n      of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing\\n      was projecting. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the\\n      path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he\\n      could never have set his foot upon firm land again. He held an\\n      old black boot in the air. “Meyers, Toronto,” was printed on the\\n      leather inside.\\n\\n      “It is worth a mud bath,” said he. “It is our friend Sir Henry’s\\n      missing boot.”\\n\\n      “Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.”\\n\\n      “Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the\\n      hound upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still\\n      clutching it. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight.\\n      We know at least that he came so far in safety.”\\n\\n      But more than that we were never destined to know, though there\\n      was much which we might surmise. There was no chance of finding\\n      footsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon\\n      them, but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass\\n      we all looked eagerly for them. But no slightest sign of them\\n      ever met our eyes. If the earth told a true story, then Stapleton\\n      never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled\\n      through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in the heart of\\n      the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass\\n      which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is\\n      forever buried.\\n\\n      Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had\\n      hid his savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled\\n      with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it\\n      were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners, driven\\n      away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp. In one\\n      of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones\\n      showed where the animal had been confined. A skeleton with a\\n      tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the _débris_.\\n\\n      “A dog!” said Holmes. “By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor\\n      Mortimer will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that\\n      this place contains any secret which we have not already\\n      fathomed. He could hide his hound, but he could not hush its\\n      voice, and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not\\n      pleasant to hear. On an emergency he could keep the hound in the\\n      out-house at Merripit, but it was always a risk, and it was only\\n      on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end of all his\\n      efforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no doubt\\n      the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was\\n      suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and\\n      by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the\\n      poor devil of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did,\\n      and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw such a creature\\n      bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track. It was\\n      a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving your\\n      victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too\\n      closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many\\n      have done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson, and I say\\n      it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more\\n      dangerous man than he who is lying yonder”—he swept his long arm\\n      towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which\\n      stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the\\n      moor.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15.\\n\\nA Retrospection\\n\\n      It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and\\n      foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room\\n      in Baker Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to\\n      Devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost\\n      importance, in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious\\n      conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection with the famous card\\n      scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second he had\\n      defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge of\\n      murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her\\n      step-daughter, Mlle. Carére, the young lady who, as it will be\\n      remembered, was found six months later alive and married in New\\n      York. My friend was in excellent spirits over the success which\\n      had attended a succession of difficult and important cases, so\\n      that I was able to induce him to discuss the details of the\\n      Baskerville mystery. I had waited patiently for the opportunity\\n      for I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, and\\n      that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its\\n      present work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir Henry and\\n      Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that long\\n      voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his\\n      shattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so\\n      that it was natural that the subject should come up for\\n      discussion.\\n\\n      “The whole course of events,” said Holmes, “from the point of\\n      view of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and\\n      direct, although to us, who had no means in the beginning of\\n      knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of\\n      the facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex. I have had the\\n      advantage of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton, and the case\\n      has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that\\n      there is anything which has remained a secret to us. You will\\n      find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my\\n      indexed list of cases.”\\n\\n      “Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of\\n      events from memory.”\\n\\n      “Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts\\n      in my mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of\\n      blotting out what has passed. The barrister who has his case at\\n      his fingers’ ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his\\n      own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it\\n      all out of his head once more. So each of my cases displaces the\\n      last, and Mlle. Carére has blurred my recollection of Baskerville\\n      Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my\\n      notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French lady and the\\n      infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes, however, I\\n      will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and you\\n      will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.\\n\\n      “My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait\\n      did not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He\\n      was a son of that Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir\\n      Charles, who fled with a sinister reputation to South America,\\n      where he was said to have died unmarried. He did, as a matter of\\n      fact, marry, and had one child, this fellow, whose real name is\\n      the same as his father’s. He married Beryl Garcia, one of the\\n      beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a considerable sum\\n      of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and fled to\\n      England, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire.\\n      His reason for attempting this special line of business was that\\n      he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon\\n      the voyage home, and that he had used this man’s ability to make\\n      the undertaking a success. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and\\n      the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy.\\n      The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to\\n      Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his fortune, his schemes\\n      for the future, and his taste for entomology to the south of\\n      England. I learned at the British Museum that he was a recognized\\n      authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur has\\n      been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his\\n      Yorkshire days, been the first to describe.\\n\\n      “We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be\\n      of such intense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made\\n      inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and\\n      a valuable estate. When he went to Devonshire his plans were, I\\n      believe, exceedingly hazy, but that he meant mischief from the\\n      first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him\\n      in the character of his sister. The idea of using her as a decoy\\n      was clearly already in his mind, though he may not have been\\n      certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He meant\\n      in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool\\n      or run any risk for that end. His first act was to establish\\n      himself as near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second\\n      was to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and\\n      with the neighbours.\\n\\n      “The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so\\n      prepared the way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue\\n      to call him, knew that the old man’s heart was weak and that a\\n      shock would kill him. So much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer.\\n      He had heard also that Sir Charles was superstitious and had\\n      taken this grim legend very seriously. His ingenious mind\\n      instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to\\n      death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the\\n      guilt to the real murderer.\\n\\n      “Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with\\n      considerable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content\\n      to work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to make\\n      the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. The\\n      dog he bought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in\\n      Fulham Road. It was the strongest and most savage in their\\n      possession. He brought it down by the North Devon line and walked\\n      a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without\\n      exciting any remarks. He had already on his insect hunts learned\\n      to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a safe\\n      hiding-place for the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited\\n      his chance.\\n\\n      “But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be\\n      decoyed outside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapleton\\n      lurked about with his hound, but without avail. It was during\\n      these fruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen by\\n      peasants, and that the legend of the demon dog received a new\\n      confirmation. He had hoped that his wife might lure Sir Charles\\n      to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly independent. She\\n      would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a\\n      sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy.\\n      Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her.\\n      She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton\\n      was at a deadlock.\\n\\n      “He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that\\n      Sir Charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the\\n      minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman,\\n      Mrs. Laura Lyons. By representing himself as a single man he\\n      acquired complete influence over her, and he gave her to\\n      understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her\\n      husband he would marry her. His plans were suddenly brought to a\\n      head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the\\n      Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he himself\\n      pretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim might\\n      get beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons\\n      to write this letter, imploring the old man to give her an\\n      interview on the evening before his departure for London. He\\n      then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so\\n      had the chance for which he had waited.\\n\\n      “Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to\\n      get his hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring\\n      the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that\\n      he would find the old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its\\n      master, sprang over the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate\\n      baronet, who fled screaming down the yew alley. In that gloomy\\n      tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge\\n      black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding\\n      after its victim. He fell dead at the end of the alley from heart\\n      disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the grassy border\\n      while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but the\\n      man’s was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had\\n      probably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had\\n      turned away again. It was then that it left the print which was\\n      actually observed by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and\\n      hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was\\n      left which puzzled the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and\\n      finally brought the case within the scope of our observation.\\n\\n      “So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive\\n      the devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost\\n      impossible to make a case against the real murderer. His only\\n      accomplice was one who could never give him away, and the\\n      grotesque, inconceivable nature of the device only served to make\\n      it more effective. Both of the women concerned in the case, Mrs.\\n      Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a strong suspicion\\n      against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he had designs upon\\n      the old man, and also of the existence of the hound. Mrs. Lyons\\n      knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the death\\n      occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was\\n      only known to him. However, both of them were under his\\n      influence, and he had nothing to fear from them. The first half\\n      of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult\\n      still remained.\\n\\n      “It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of\\n      an heir in Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from\\n      his friend Dr. Mortimer, and he was told by the latter all\\n      details about the arrival of Henry Baskerville. Stapleton’s first\\n      idea was that this young stranger from Canada might possibly be\\n      done to death in London without coming down to Devonshire at all.\\n      He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in\\n      laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her long\\n      out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her.\\n      It was for this reason that he took her to London with him. They\\n      lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven\\n      Street, which was actually one of those called upon by my agent\\n      in search of evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her\\n      room while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to\\n      Baker Street and afterwards to the station and to the\\n      Northumberland Hotel. His wife had some inkling of his plans; but\\n      she had such a fear of her husband—a fear founded upon brutal\\n      ill-treatment—that she dare not write to warn the man whom she\\n      knew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into Stapleton’s\\n      hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we know, she\\n      adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form\\n      the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. It\\n      reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his\\n      danger.\\n\\n      “It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir\\n      Henry’s attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he\\n      might always have the means of setting him upon his track. With\\n      characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once,\\n      and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel\\n      was well bribed to help him in his design. By chance, however,\\n      the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and,\\n      therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had it returned and\\n      obtained another—a most instructive incident, since it proved\\n      conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,\\n      as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an\\n      old boot and this indifference to a new one. The more _outré_ and\\n      grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be\\n      examined, and the very point which appears to complicate a case\\n      is, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the one\\n      which is most likely to elucidate it.\\n\\n      “Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed\\n      always by Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our rooms\\n      and of my appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am\\n      inclined to think that Stapleton’s career of crime has been by no\\n      means limited to this single Baskerville affair. It is suggestive\\n      that during the last three years there have been four\\n      considerable burglaries in the west country, for none of which\\n      was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at Folkestone\\n      Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling of\\n      the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot\\n      doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this\\n      fashion, and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous\\n      man.\\n\\n      “We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when\\n      he got away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in\\n      sending back my own name to me through the cabman. From that\\n      moment he understood that I had taken over the case in London,\\n      and that therefore there was no chance for him there. He returned\\n      to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet.”\\n\\n      “One moment!” said I. “You have, no doubt, described the sequence\\n      of events correctly, but there is one point which you have left\\n      unexplained. What became of the hound when its master was in\\n      London?”\\n\\n      “I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly\\n      of importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a\\n      confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in\\n      his power by sharing all his plans with him. There was an old\\n      manservant at Merripit House, whose name was Anthony. His\\n      connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years,\\n      as far back as the school-mastering days, so that he must have\\n      been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and\\n      wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country.\\n      It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,\\n      while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries.\\n      The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but\\n      with a curious lisping accent. I have myself seen this old man\\n      cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had marked\\n      out. It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of his\\n      master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may never\\n      have known the purpose for which the beast was used.\\n\\n      “The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were\\n      soon followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I\\n      stood myself at that time. It may possibly recur to your memory\\n      that when I examined the paper upon which the printed words were\\n      fastened I made a close inspection for the water-mark. In doing\\n      so I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was conscious of\\n      a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine. There are\\n      seventy-five perfumes, which it is very necessary that a criminal\\n      expert should be able to distinguish from each other, and cases\\n      have more than once within my own experience depended upon their\\n      prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a lady,\\n      and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons.\\n      Thus I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the\\n      criminal before ever we went to the west country.\\n\\n      “It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that\\n      I could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly\\n      on his guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included,\\n      and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My\\n      hardships were not so great as you imagined, though such trifling\\n      details must never interfere with the investigation of a case. I\\n      stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut\\n      upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of\\n      action. Cartwright had come down with me, and in his disguise as\\n      a country boy he was of great assistance to me. I was dependent\\n      upon him for food and clean linen. When I was watching Stapleton,\\n      Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I was able to\\n      keep my hand upon all the strings.\\n\\n      “I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly,\\n      being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey.\\n      They were of great service to me, and especially that one\\n      incidentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton’s. I was\\n      able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew\\n      at last exactly how I stood. The case had been considerably\\n      complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the\\n      relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you cleared\\n      up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the same\\n      conclusions from my own observations.\\n\\n      “By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a\\n      complete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case\\n      which could go to a jury. Even Stapleton’s attempt upon Sir Henry\\n      that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict\\n      did not help us much in proving murder against our man. There\\n      seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and to\\n      do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected,\\n      as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to our\\n      client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton\\n      to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been exposed to\\n      this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case,\\n      but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing\\n      spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog\\n      which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. We\\n      succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and\\n      Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one. A long journey\\n      may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered\\n      nerves but also from his wounded feelings. His love for the lady\\n      was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this\\n      black business was that he should have been deceived by her.\\n\\n      “It only remains to indicate the part which she had played\\n      throughout. There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an\\n      influence over her which may have been love or may have been\\n      fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means\\n      incompatible emotions. It was, at least, absolutely effective. At\\n      his command she consented to pass as his sister, though he found\\n      the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her\\n      the direct accessory to murder. She was ready to warn Sir Henry\\n      so far as she could without implicating her husband, and again\\n      and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have\\n      been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying\\n      court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still\\n      he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which\\n      revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so\\n      cleverly concealed. By encouraging the intimacy he made it\\n      certain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit House\\n      and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he\\n      desired. On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned\\n      suddenly against him. She had learned something of the death of\\n      the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the\\n      outhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She\\n      taxed her husband with his intended crime, and a furious scene\\n      followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a\\n      rival in his love. Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter\\n      hatred, and he saw that she would betray him. He tied her up,\\n      therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry,\\n      and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put down\\n      the baronet’s death to the curse of his family, as they certainly\\n      would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished\\n      fact and to keep silent upon what she knew. In this I fancy that\\n      in any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not\\n      been there, his doom would none the less have been sealed. A\\n      woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an injury so\\n      lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes,\\n      I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case. I\\n      do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained.”\\n\\n      “He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done\\n      the old uncle with his bogie hound.”\\n\\n      “The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not\\n      frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the\\n      resistance which might be offered.”\\n\\n      “No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came\\n      into the succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the\\n      heir, had been living unannounced under another name so close to\\n      the property? How could he claim it without causing suspicion and\\n      inquiry?”\\n\\n      “It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much\\n      when you expect me to solve it. The past and the present are\\n      within the field of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the\\n      future is a hard question to answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her\\n      husband discuss the problem on several occasions. There were\\n      three possible courses. He might claim the property from South\\n      America, establish his identity before the British authorities\\n      there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to England at\\n      all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short\\n      time that he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish an\\n      accomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir,\\n      and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. We\\n      cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found\\n      some way out of the difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have\\n      had some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we\\n      may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels. I have a box\\n      for _Les Huguenots_. Have you heard the De Reszkes? Might I\\n      trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we can stop at\\n      Marcini’s for a little dinner on the way?”\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n'"

it           i think   said i  following as far as i could the methods of my       companion   that dr  mortimer is a successful  elderly medical       man  well esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of       their appreciation           good   said holmes   excellent           i think also that the probability is in favour of his being a       country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on       foot           why so           because this stick  though originally a very handsome one has       been so knocked about that i can hardly imagine a town       practitioner carrying it  the thick iron ferrule is worn down  so       it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with       it           perfectly sound   said holmes          and then again  there is the  friends of the c c h   i should       guess that to be the something hunt  the local hunt to whose       members he has possibly given some surgical assistance  and which       has made him a small presentation in return           really  watson  you excel yourself   said holmes  pushing back       his chair and lighting a cigarette   i am bound to say that in       all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own       small achievements you have habitually underrated your own       abilities  it may be that you are not yourself luminous  but you       are a conductor of light  some people without possessing genius       have a remarkable power of stimulating it  i confess  my dear       fellow  that i am very much in your debt          he had never said as much before  and i must admit that his words       gave me keen pleasure  for i had often been piqued by his       indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which i had       made to give publicity to his methods  i was proud  too  to think       that i had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way       which earned his approval  he now took the stick from my hands       and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes  then with       an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette  and       carrying the cane to the window  he looked over it again with a       convex lens          interesting  though elementary   said he as he returned to his       favourite corner of the settee   there are certainly one or two       indications upon the stick  it gives us the basis for several       deductions           has anything escaped me   i asked with some self importance   i       trust that there is nothing of consequence which i have       overlooked           i am afraid  my dear watson  that most of your conclusions were       erroneous  when i said that you stimulated me i meant  to be       frank  that in noting your fallacies i was occasionally guided       towards the truth  not that you are entirely wrong in this       instance  the man is certainly a country practitioner  and he       walks a good deal           then i was right           to that extent           but that was all           no  no  my dear watson  not all by no means all  i would       suggest  for example  that a presentation to a doctor is more       likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt  and that when       the initials  c c   are placed before that hospital the words        charing cross  very naturally suggest themselves           you may be right           the probability lies in that direction  and if we take this as a       working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our       construction of this unknown visitor           well  then  supposing that  c c h   does stand for  charing       cross hospital   what further inferences may we draw           do none suggest themselves  you know my methods  apply them           i can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has       practised in town before going to the country           i think that we might venture a little farther than this  look       at it in this light  on what occasion would it be most probable       that such a presentation would be made  when would his friends       unite to give him a pledge of their good will  obviously at the       moment when dr  mortimer withdrew from the service of the       hospital in order to start a practice for himself  we know there       has been a presentation  we believe there has been a change from       a town hospital to a country practice  is it  then  stretching       our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the       occasion of the change           it certainly seems probable           now  you will observe that he could not have been on the  staff        of the hospital  since only a man well established in a london       practice could hold such a position  and such a one would not       drift into the country  what was he  then  if he was in the       hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a       house surgeon or a house physician little more than a senior       student  and he left five years ago the date is on the stick  so       your grave  middle aged family practitioner vanishes into thin       air  my dear watson  and there emerges a young fellow under       thirty  amiable  unambitious  absent minded  and the possessor of       a favourite dog  which i should describe roughly as being larger       than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff          i laughed incredulously as sherlock holmes leaned back in his       settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling          as to the latter part  i have no means of checking you   said i         but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars       about the man s age and professional career   from my small       medical shelf i took down the medical directory and turned up the       name  there were several mortimers  but only one who could be our       visitor  i read his record aloud            mortimer  james  m r c s         grimpen  dartmoor  devon          house surgeon  from      to       at charing cross hospital          winner of the jackson prize for comparative pathology  with         essay entitled  is disease a reversion    corresponding member         of the swedish pathological society   author of  some freaks of         atavism    lancet           do we progress     journal of         psychology   march         medical officer for the parishes of         grimpen  thorsley  and high barrow           no mention of that local hunt  watson   said holmes with a       mischievous smile   but a country doctor  as you very astutely       observed  i think that i am fairly justified in my inferences  as       to the adjectives  i said  if i remember right  amiable        unambitious  and absent minded  it is my experience that it is       only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials  only       an unambitious one who abandons a london career for the country        and only an absent minded one who leaves his stick and not his       visiting card after waiting an hour in your room           and the dog           has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master        being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle        and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible  the dog s       jaw  as shown in the space between these marks  is too broad in       my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff  it       may have been yes  by jove  it  is  a curly haired spaniel          he had risen and paced the room as he spoke  now he halted in the       recess of the window  there was such a ring of conviction in his       voice that i glanced up in surprise          my dear fellow  how can you possibly be so sure of that           for the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our       very door step  and there is the ring of its owner  don t move  i       beg you  watson  he is a professional brother of yours  and your       presence may be of assistance to me  now is the dramatic moment       of fate  watson  when you hear a step upon the stair which is       walking into your life  and you know not whether for good or ill        what does dr  james mortimer  the man of science  ask of sherlock       holmes  the specialist in crime  come in          the appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me  since i had       expected a typical country practitioner  he was a very tall  thin       man  with a long nose like a beak  which jutted out between two       keen  grey eyes  set closely together and sparkling brightly from       behind a pair of gold rimmed glasses  he was clad in a       professional but rather slovenly fashion  for his frock coat was       dingy and his trousers frayed  though young  his long back was       already bowed  and he walked with a forward thrust of his head       and a general air of peering benevolence  as he entered his eyes       fell upon the stick in holmes s hand  and he ran towards it with       an exclamation of joy   i am so very glad   said he   i was not       sure whether i had left it here or in the shipping office  i       would not lose that stick for the world           a presentation  i see   said holmes          yes  sir           from charing cross hospital           from one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage           dear  dear  that s bad   said holmes  shaking his head         dr  mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment         why was it bad           only that you have disarranged our little deductions  your       marriage  you say           yes  sir  i married  and so left the hospital  and with it all       hopes of a consulting practice  it was necessary to make a home       of my own           come  come  we are not so far wrong  after all   said holmes         and now  dr  james mortimer           mister  sir  mister a humble m r c s           and a man of precise mind  evidently           a dabbler in science  mr  holmes  a picker up of shells on the       shores of the great unknown ocean  i presume that it is mr        sherlock holmes whom i am addressing and not           no  this is my friend dr  watson           glad to meet you  sir  i have heard your name mentioned in       connection with that of your friend  you interest me very much        mr  holmes  i had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or       such well marked supra orbital development  would you have any       objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure  a       cast of your skull  sir  until the original is available  would       be an ornament to any anthropological museum  it is not my       intention to be fulsome  but i confess that i covet your skull          sherlock holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair   you are       an enthusiast in your line of thought  i perceive  sir  as i am       in mine   said he   i observe from your forefinger that you make       your own cigarettes  have no hesitation in lighting one          the man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the       other with surprising dexterity  he had long  quivering fingers       as agile and restless as the antenn  of an insect         holmes was silent  but his little darting glances showed me the       interest which he took in our curious companion   i presume        sir   said he at last   that it was not merely for the purpose of       examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here       last night and again today           no  sir  no  though i am happy to have had the opportunity of       doing that as well  i came to you  mr  holmes  because i       recognized that i am myself an unpractical man and because i am       suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary       problem  recognizing  as i do  that you are the second highest       expert in europe           indeed  sir  may i inquire who has the honour to be the first         asked holmes with some asperity          to the man of precisely scientific mind the work of monsieur       bertillon must always appeal strongly           then had you not better consult him           i said  sir  to the precisely scientific mind  but as a       practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone        i trust  sir  that i have not inadvertently           just a little   said holmes   i think  dr  mortimer  you would       do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly       what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my       assistance      chapter     the curse of the baskervilles         i have in my pocket a manuscript   said dr  james mortimer          i observed it as you entered the room   said holmes          it is an old manuscript           early eighteenth century  unless it is a forgery           how can you say that  sir           you have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all       the time that you have been talking  it would be a poor expert       who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so        you may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject        i put that at                the exact date is        dr  mortimer drew it from his       breast pocket   this family paper was committed to my care by sir       charles baskerville  whose sudden and tragic death some three       months ago created so much excitement in devonshire  i may say       that i was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant        he was a strong minded man  sir  shrewd  practical  and as       unimaginative as i am myself  yet he took this document very       seriously  and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did       eventually overtake him          holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it       upon his knee   you will observe  watson  the alternative use of       the long  s  and the short  it is one of several indications       which enabled me to fix the date          i looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded       script  at the head was written   baskerville hall   and below in       large  scrawling figures                  it appears to be a statement of some sort           yes  it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the       baskerville family           but i understand that it is something more modern and practical       upon which you wish to consult me           most modern  a most practical  pressing matter  which must be       decided within twenty four hours  but the manuscript is short and       is intimately connected with the affair  with your permission i       will read it to you          holmes leaned back in his chair  placed his finger tips together        and closed his eyes  with an air of resignation  dr  mortimer       turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high  cracking       voice the following curious  old world narrative            of the origin of the hound of the baskervilles there have been         many statements  yet as i come in a direct line from hugo         baskerville  and as i had the story from my father  who also         had it from his  i have set it down with all belief that it         occurred even as is here set forth  and i would have you         believe  my sons  that the same justice which punishes sin may         also most graciously forgive it  and that no ban is so heavy         but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed   learn         then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past  but         rather to be circumspect in the future  that those foul         passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not         again be loosed to our undoing                know then that in the time of the great rebellion  the             history of which by the learned lord clarendon i most             earnestly commend to your attention  this manor of             baskerville was held by hugo of that name  nor can it be             gainsaid that he was a most wild  profane  and godless man               this  in truth  his neighbours might have pardoned  seeing             that saints have never flourished in those parts  but there             was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his             name a by word through the west   it chanced that this hugo             came to love  if  indeed  so dark a passion may be known             under so bright a name  the daughter of a yeoman who held             lands near the baskerville estate  but the young maiden              being discreet and of good repute  would ever avoid him              for she feared his evil name   so it came to pass that one             michaelmas this hugo  with five or six of his idle and             wicked companions  stole down upon the farm and carried off             the maiden  her father and brothers being from home  as he             well knew   when they had brought her to the hall the             maiden was placed in an upper chamber  while hugo and his             friends sat down to a long carouse  as was their nightly             custom   now  the poor lass upstairs was like to have her             wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths             which came up to her from below  for they say that the             words used by hugo baskerville  when he was in wine  were             such as might blast the man who said them   at last in the             stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted             the bravest or most active man  for by the aid of the             growth of ivy which covered  and still covers  the south             wall she came down from under the eaves  and so homeward             across the moor  there being three leagues betwixt the hall             and her father s farm                it chanced that some little time later hugo left his             guests to carry food and drink with other worse things              perchance to his captive  and so found the cage empty and             the bird escaped   then  as it would seem  he became as one             that hath a devil  for  rushing down the stairs into the             dining hall  he sprang upon the great table  flagons and             trenchers flying before him  and he cried aloud before all             the company that he would that very night render his body             and soul to the powers of evil if he might but overtake the             wench   and while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of             the man  one more wicked or  it may be  more drunken than             the rest  cried out that they should put the hounds upon             her   whereat hugo ran from the house  crying to his grooms             that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack  and             giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid s  he swung them             to the line  and so off full cry in the moonlight over the             moor                now  for some space the revellers stood agape  unable to             understand all that had been done in such haste   but anon             their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which             was like to be done upon the moorlands   everything was now             in an uproar  some calling for their pistols  some for             their horses  and some for another flask of wine   but at             length some sense came back to their crazed minds  and the             whole of them  thirteen in number  took horse and started             in pursuit   the moon shone clear above them  and they rode             swiftly abreast  taking that course which the maid must             needs have taken if she were to reach her own home                they had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the             night shepherds upon the moorlands  and they cried to him             to know if he had seen the hunt   and the man  as the story             goes  was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak              but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy             maiden  with the hounds upon her track    but i have seen             more than that   said he   for hugo baskerville passed me             upon his black mare  and there ran mute behind him such a             hound of hell as god forbid should ever be at my heels                so the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward               but soon their skins turned cold  for there came a             galloping across the moor  and the black mare  dabbled with             white froth  went past with trailing bridle and empty             saddle   then the revellers rode close together  for a             great fear was on them  but they still followed over the             moor  though each  had he been alone  would have been right             glad to have turned his horse s head   riding slowly in             this fashion they came at last upon the hounds   these              though known for their valour and their breed  were             whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal              as we call it  upon the moor  some slinking away and some              with starting hackles and staring eyes  gazing down the             narrow valley before them                the company had come to a halt  more sober men  as you may             guess  than when they started   the most of them would by             no means advance  but three of them  the boldest  or it may             be the most drunken  rode forward down the goyal  now  it             opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great             stones  still to be seen there  which were set by certain             forgotten peoples in the days of old  the moon was shining             bright upon the clearing  and there in the centre lay the             unhappy maid where she had fallen  dead of fear and of             fatigue   but it was not the sight of her body  nor yet was             it that of the body of hugo baskerville lying near her              which raised the hair upon the heads of these three             dare devil roysterers  but it was that  standing over hugo              and plucking at his throat  there stood a foul thing  a             great  black beast  shaped like a hound  yet larger than             any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon   and even             as they looked the thing tore the throat out of hugo             baskerville  on which  as it turned its blazing eyes and             dripping jaws upon them  the three shrieked with fear and             rode for dear life  still screaming  across the moor   one              it is said  died that very night of what he had seen  and             the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their             days                such is the tale  my sons  of the coming of the hound             which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever             since   if i have set it down it is because that which is             clearly known hath less terror than that which is but             hinted at and guessed   nor can it be denied that many of             the family have been unhappy in their deaths  which have             been sudden  bloody  and mysterious   yet may we shelter             ourselves in the infinite goodness of providence  which             would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or             fourth generation which is threatened in holy writ   to             that providence  my sons  i hereby commend you  and i             counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the             moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are             exalted                 this from hugo baskerville to his sons rodger and john              with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their             sister elizabeth           when dr  mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he       pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at mr        sherlock holmes  the latter yawned and tossed the end of his       cigarette into the fire          well   said he          do you not find it interesting           to a collector of fairy tales          dr  mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket          now  mr  holmes  we will give you something a little more       recent  this is the  devon county chronicle  of may   th of this       year  it is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of       sir charles baskerville which occurred a few days before that       date          my friend leaned a little forward and his expression became       intent  our visitor readjusted his glasses and began            the recent sudden death of sir charles baskerville  whose name         has been mentioned as the probable liberal candidate for         mid devon at the next election  has cast a gloom over the         county   though sir charles had resided at baskerville hall for         a comparatively short period his amiability of character and         extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who         had been brought into contact with him   in these days of          nouveaux riches  it is refreshing to find a case where the         scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days         is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him         to restore the fallen grandeur of his line   sir charles  as is         well known  made large sums of money in south african         speculation  more wise than those who go on until the wheel         turns against them  he realised his gains and returned to         england with them   it is only two years since he took up his         residence at baskerville hall  and it is common talk how large         were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have         been interrupted by his death   being himself childless  it was         his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should          within his own lifetime  profit by his good fortune  and many         will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end   his         generous donations to local and county charities have been         frequently chronicled in these columns                the circumstances connected with the death of sir charles             cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the             inquest  but at least enough has been done to dispose of             those rumours to which local superstition has given rise              there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play  or to             imagine that death could be from any but natural causes              sir charles was a widower  and a man who may be said to             have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind  in             spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his             personal tastes  and his indoor servants at baskerville             hall consisted of a married couple named barrymore  the             husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper  their             evidence  corroborated by that of several friends  tends to             show that sir charles s health has for some time been             impaired  and points especially to some affection of the             heart  manifesting itself in changes of colour              breathlessness  and acute attacks of nervous depression              dr  james mortimer  the friend and medical attendant of the             deceased  has given evidence to the same effect                the facts of the case are simple   sir charles baskerville             was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking             down the famous yew alley of baskerville hall   the             evidence of the barrymores shows that this had been his             custom  on the fourth of may sir charles had declared his             intention of starting next day for london  and had ordered             barrymore to prepare his luggage   that night he went out             as usual for his nocturnal walk  in the course of which he             was in the habit of smoking a cigar   he never returned               at twelve o clock barrymore  finding the hall door still             open  became alarmed  and  lighting a lantern  went in             search of his master   the day had been wet  and sir             charles s footmarks were easily traced down the alley               halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on             to the moor  there were indications that sir charles had             stood for some little time here   he then proceeded down             the alley  and it was at the far end of it that his body             was discovered  one fact which has not been explained is             the statement of barrymore that his master s footprints             altered their character from the time that he passed the             moor gate  and that he appeared from thence onward to have             been walking upon his toes   one murphy  a gipsy             horse dealer  was on the moor at no great distance at the             time  but he appears by his own confession to have been the             worse for drink  he declares that he heard cries but is             unable to state from what direction they came   no signs of             violence were to be discovered upon sir charles s person              and though the doctor s evidence pointed to an almost             incredible facial distortion so great that dr  mortimer             refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend             and patient who lay before him it was explained that that             is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspn a and             death from cardiac exhaustion   this explanation was borne             out by the post mortem examination  which showed             long standing organic disease  and the coroner s jury             returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence               it is well that this is so  for it is obviously of the             utmost importance that sir charles s heir should settle at             the hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly             interrupted   had the prosaic finding of the coroner not             finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been             whispered in connection with the affair  it might have been             difficult to find a tenant for baskerville hall   it is             understood that the next of kin is mr  henry baskerville              if he be still alive  the son of sir charles baskerville s             younger brother   the young man when last heard of was in             america  and inquiries are being instituted with a view to             informing him of his good fortune          dr  mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket         those are the public facts  mr  holmes  in connection with the       death of sir charles baskerville           i must thank you   said sherlock holmes   for calling my       attention to a case which certainly presents some features of       interest  i had observed some newspaper comment at the time  but       i was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the       vatican cameos  and in my anxiety to oblige the pope i lost touch       with several interesting english cases  this article  you say        contains all the public facts           it does           then let me have the private ones   he leaned back  put his       finger tips together  and assumed his most impassive and judicial       expression          in doing so   said dr  mortimer  who had begun to show signs of       some strong emotion   i am telling that which i have not confided       to anyone  my motive for withholding it from the coroner s       inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in       the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition        i had the further motive that baskerville hall  as the paper       says  would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to       increase its already rather grim reputation  for both these       reasons i thought that i was justified in telling rather less       than i knew  since no practical good could result from it  but       with you there is no reason why i should not be perfectly frank          the moor is very sparsely inhabited  and those who live near       each other are thrown very much together  for this reason i saw a       good deal of sir charles baskerville  with the exception of mr        frankland  of lafter hall  and mr  stapleton  the naturalist        there are no other men of education within many miles  sir       charles was a retiring man  but the chance of his illness brought       us together  and a community of interests in science kept us so        he had brought back much scientific information from south       africa  and many a charming evening we have spent together       discussing the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the       hottentot          within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me       that sir charles s nervous system was strained to the breaking       point  he had taken this legend which i have read you exceedingly       to heart so much so that  although he would walk in his own       grounds  nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at       night  incredible as it may appear to you  mr  holmes  he was       honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family  and       certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors       were not encouraging  the idea of some ghastly presence       constantly haunted him  and on more than one occasion he has       asked me whether i had on my medical journeys at night ever seen       any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound  the latter       question he put to me several times  and always with a voice       which vibrated with excitement          i can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some       three weeks before the fatal event  he chanced to be at his hall       door  i had descended from my gig and was standing in front of       him  when i saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and       stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror  i       whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something       which i took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the       drive  so excited and alarmed was he that i was compelled to go       down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for       it  it was gone  however  and the incident appeared to make the       worst impression upon his mind  i stayed with him all the       evening  and it was on that occasion  to explain the emotion       which he had shown  that he confided to my keeping that narrative       which i read to you when first i came  i mention this small       episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy       which followed  but i was convinced at the time that the matter       was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no       justification          it was at my advice that sir charles was about to go to london        his heart was  i knew  affected  and the constant anxiety in       which he lived  however chimerical the cause of it might be  was       evidently having a serious effect upon his health  i thought that       a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a       new man  mr  stapleton  a mutual friend who was much concerned at       his state of health  was of the same opinion  at the last instant       came this terrible catastrophe          on the night of sir charles s death barrymore the butler  who       made the discovery  sent perkins the groom on horseback to me        and as i was sitting up late i was able to reach baskerville hall       within an hour of the event  i checked and corroborated all the       facts which were mentioned at the inquest  i followed the       footsteps down the yew alley  i saw the spot at the moor gate       where he seemed to have waited  i remarked the change in the       shape of the prints after that point  i noted that there were no       other footsteps save those of barrymore on the soft gravel  and       finally i carefully examined the body  which had not been touched       until my arrival  sir charles lay on his face  his arms out  his       fingers dug into the ground  and his features convulsed with some       strong emotion to such an extent that i could hardly have sworn       to his identity  there was certainly no physical injury of any       kind  but one false statement was made by barrymore at the       inquest  he said that there were no traces upon the ground round       the body  he did not observe any  but i did some little distance       off  but fresh and clear           footprints           footprints           a man s or a woman s          dr  mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant  and his voice       sank almost to a whisper as he answered          mr  holmes  they were the footprints of a gigantic hound      chapter     the problem        i confess at these words a shudder passed through me  there was a       thrill in the doctor s voice which showed that he was himself       deeply moved by that which he told us  holmes leaned forward in       his excitement and his eyes had the hard  dry glitter which shot       from them when he was keenly interested          you saw this           as clearly as i see you           and you said nothing           what was the use           how was it that no one else saw it           the marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave       them a thought  i don t suppose i should have done so had i not       known this legend           there are many sheep dogs on the moor           no doubt  but this was no sheep dog           you say it was large           enormous           but it had not approached the body           no           what sort of night was it           damp and raw           but not actually raining           no           what is the alley like           there are two lines of old yew hedge  twelve feet high and       impenetrable  the walk in the centre is about eight feet across           is there anything between the hedges and the walk           yes  there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either       side           i understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a       gate           yes  the wicket gate which leads on to the moor           is there any other opening           none           so that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it       from the house or else to enter it by the moor gate           there is an exit through a summer house at the far end           had sir charles reached this           no  he lay about fifty yards from it           now  tell me  dr  mortimer and this is important the marks which       you saw were on the path and not on the grass           no marks could show on the grass           were they on the same side of the path as the moor gate           yes  they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the       moor gate           you interest me exceedingly  another point  was the wicket gate       closed           closed and padlocked           how high was it           about four feet high           then anyone could have got over it           yes           and what marks did you see by the wicket gate           none in particular           good heaven  did no one examine           yes  i examined  myself           and found nothing           it was all very confused  sir charles had evidently stood there       for five or ten minutes           how do you know that           because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar           excellent  this is a colleague  watson  after our own heart  but       the marks           he had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel  i       could discern no others          sherlock holmes struck his hand against his knee with an       impatient gesture          if i had only been there   he cried   it is evidently a case of       extraordinary interest  and one which presented immense       opportunities to the scientific expert  that gravel page upon       which i might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by       the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants  oh  dr        mortimer  dr  mortimer  to think that you should not have called       me in  you have indeed much to answer for           i could not call you in  mr  holmes  without disclosing these       facts to the world  and i have already given my reasons for not       wishing to do so  besides  besides           why do you hesitate           there is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of       detectives is helpless           you mean that the thing is supernatural           i did not positively say so           no  but you evidently think it           since the tragedy  mr  holmes  there have come to my ears       several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled       order of nature           for example           i find that before the terrible event occurred several people       had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this       baskerville demon  and which could not possibly be any animal       known to science  they all agreed that it was a huge creature        luminous  ghastly  and spectral  i have cross examined these men        one of them a hard headed countryman  one a farrier  and one a       moorland farmer  who all tell the same story of this dreadful       apparition  exactly corresponding to the hell hound of the       legend  i assure you that there is a reign of terror in the       district  and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at       night           and you  a trained man of science  believe it to be       supernatural           i do not know what to believe          holmes shrugged his shoulders   i have hitherto confined my       investigations to this world   said he   in a modest way i have       combated evil  but to take on the father of evil himself would        perhaps  be too ambitious a task  yet you must admit that the       footmark is material           the original hound was material enough to tug a man s throat       out  and yet he was diabolical as well           i see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists  but       now  dr  mortimer  tell me this  if you hold these views  why       have you come to consult me at all  you tell me in the same       breath that it is useless to investigate sir charles s death  and       that you desire me to do it           i did not say that i desired you to do it           then  how can i assist you           by advising me as to what i should do with sir henry       baskerville  who arrives at waterloo station  dr  mortimer looked       at his watch  in exactly one hour and a quarter           he being the heir           yes  on the death of sir charles we inquired for this young       gentleman and found that he had been farming in canada  from the       accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every       way  i speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and       executor of sir charles s will           there is no other claimant  i presume           none  the only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was       rodger baskerville  the youngest of three brothers of whom poor       sir charles was the elder  the second brother  who died young  is       the father of this lad henry  the third  rodger  was the black       sheep of the family  he came of the old masterful baskerville       strain and was the very image  they tell me  of the family       picture of old hugo  he made england too hot to hold him  fled to       central america  and died there in      of yellow fever  henry is       the last of the baskervilles  in one hour and five minutes i meet       him at waterloo station  i have had a wire that he arrived at       southampton this morning  now  mr  holmes  what would you advise       me to do with him           why should he not go to the home of his fathers           it seems natural  does it not  and yet  consider that every       baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate  i feel sure       that if sir charles could have spoken with me before his death he       would have warned me against bringing this  the last of the old       race  and the heir to great wealth  to that deadly place  and yet       it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor  bleak       countryside depends upon his presence  all the good work which       has been done by sir charles will crash to the ground if there is       no tenant of the hall  i fear lest i should be swayed too much by       my own obvious interest in the matter  and that is why i bring       the case before you and ask for your advice          holmes considered for a little time          put into plain words  the matter is this   said he   in your       opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes dartmoor an       unsafe abode for a baskerville that is your opinion           at least i might go the length of saying that there is some       evidence that this may be so           exactly  but surely  if your supernatural theory be correct  it       could work the young man evil in london as easily as in       devonshire  a devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry       would be too inconceivable a thing           you put the matter more flippantly  mr  holmes  than you would       probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these       things  your advice  then  as i understand it  is that the young       man will be as safe in devonshire as in london  he comes in fifty       minutes  what would you recommend           i recommend  sir  that you take a cab  call off your spaniel who       is scratching at my front door  and proceed to waterloo to meet       sir henry baskerville           and then           and then you will say nothing to him at all until i have made up       my mind about the matter           how long will it take you to make up your mind           twenty four hours  at ten o clock tomorrow  dr  mortimer  i will       be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here  and it will       be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring sir       henry baskerville with you           i will do so  mr  holmes   he scribbled the appointment on his       shirt cuff and hurried off in his strange  peering  absent minded       fashion  holmes stopped him at the head of the stair          only one more question  dr  mortimer  you say that before sir       charles baskerville s death several people saw this apparition       upon the moor           three people did           did any see it after           i have not heard of any           thank you  good morning          holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward       satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him          going out  watson           unless i can help you           no  my dear fellow  it is at the hour of action that i turn to       you for aid  but this is splendid  really unique from some points       of view  when you pass bradley s  would you ask him to send up a       pound of the strongest shag tobacco  thank you  it would be as       well if you could make it convenient not to return before       evening  then i should be very glad to compare impressions as to       this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this       morning          i knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my       friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during       which he weighed every particle of evidence  constructed       alternative theories  balanced one against the other  and made up       his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial        i therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to baker       street until evening  it was nearly nine o clock when i found       myself in the sitting room once more         my first impression as i opened the door was that a fire had       broken out  for the room was so filled with smoke that the light       of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it  as i entered        however  my fears were set at rest  for it was the acrid fumes of       strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me       coughing  through the haze i had a vague vision of holmes in his       dressing gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe       between his lips  several rolls of paper lay around him          caught cold  watson   said he          no  it s this poisonous atmosphere           i suppose it  is  pretty thick  now that you mention it           thick  it is intolerable           open the window  then  you have been at your club all day  i       perceive           my dear holmes           am i right           certainly  but how          he laughed at my bewildered expression   there is a delightful       freshness about you  watson  which makes it a pleasure to       exercise any small powers which i possess at your expense  a       gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day  he returns       immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his       boots  he has been a fixture therefore all day  he is not a man       with intimate friends  where  then  could he have been  is it not       obvious           well  it is rather obvious           the world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance       ever observes  where do you think that i have been           a fixture also           on the contrary  i have been to devonshire           in spirit           exactly  my body has remained in this armchair and has  i regret       to observe  consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and       an incredible amount of tobacco  after you left i sent down to       stamford s for the ordnance map of this portion of the moor  and       my spirit has hovered over it all day  i flatter myself that i       could find my way about           a large scale map  i presume           very large          he unrolled one section and held it over his knee   here you have       the particular district which concerns us  that is baskerville       hall in the middle           with a wood round it           exactly  i fancy the yew alley  though not marked under that       name  must stretch along this line  with the moor  as you       perceive  upon the right of it  this small clump of buildings       here is the hamlet of grimpen  where our friend dr  mortimer has       his headquarters  within a radius of five miles there are  as you       see  only a very few scattered dwellings  here is lafter hall        which was mentioned in the narrative  there is a house indicated       here which may be the residence of the naturalist stapleton  if i       remember right  was his name  here are two moorland farmhouses        high tor and foulmire  then fourteen miles away the great convict       prison of princetown  between and around these scattered points       extends the desolate  lifeless moor  this  then  is the stage       upon which tragedy has been played  and upon which we may help to       play it again           it must be a wild place           yes  the setting is a worthy one  if the devil did desire to       have a hand in the affairs of men           then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural       explanation           the devil s agents may be of flesh and blood  may they not        there are two questions waiting for us at the outset  the one is       whether any crime has been committed at all  the second is  what       is the crime and how was it committed  of course  if dr        mortimer s surmise should be correct  and we are dealing with       forces outside the ordinary laws of nature  there is an end of       our investigation  but we are bound to exhaust all other       hypotheses before falling back upon this one  i think we ll shut       that window again  if you don t mind  it is a singular thing  but       i find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of       thought  i have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box       to think  but that is the logical outcome of my convictions  have       you turned the case over in your mind           yes  i have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day           what do you make of it           it is very bewildering           it has certainly a character of its own  there are points of       distinction about it  that change in the footprints  for example        what do you make of that           mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that       portion of the alley           he only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest  why       should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley           what then           he was running  watson running desperately  running for his       life  running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his       face           running from what           there lies our problem  there are indications that the man was       crazed with fear before ever he began to run           how can you say that           i am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across       the moor  if that were so  and it seems most probable  only a man       who had lost his wits would have run  from  the house instead of       towards it  if the gipsy s evidence may be taken as true  he ran       with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely       to be  then  again  whom was he waiting for that night  and why       was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own       house           you think that he was waiting for someone           the man was elderly and infirm  we can understand his taking an       evening stroll  but the ground was damp and the night inclement        is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes  as       dr  mortimer  with more practical sense than i should have given       him credit for  deduced from the cigar ash           but he went out every evening           i think it unlikely that he waited at the moor gate every       evening  on the contrary  the evidence is that he avoided the       moor  that night he waited there  it was the night before he made       his departure for london  the thing takes shape  watson  it       becomes coherent  might i ask you to hand me my violin  and we       will postpone all further thought upon this business until we       have had the advantage of meeting dr  mortimer and sir henry       baskerville in the morning      chapter     sir henry baskerville        our breakfast table was cleared early  and holmes waited in his       dressing gown for the promised interview  our clients were       punctual to their appointment  for the clock had just struck ten       when dr  mortimer was shown up  followed by the young baronet        the latter was a small  alert  dark eyed man about thirty years       of age  very sturdily built  with thick black eyebrows and a       strong  pugnacious face  he wore a ruddy tinted tweed suit and       had the weather beaten appearance of one who has spent most of       his time in the open air  and yet there was something in his       steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated       the gentleman          this is sir henry baskerville   said dr  mortimer          why  yes   said he   and the strange thing is  mr  sherlock       holmes  that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to       you this morning i should have come on my own account  i       understand that you think out little puzzles  and i ve had one       this morning which wants more thinking out than i am able to give       it           pray take a seat  sir henry  do i understand you to say that you       have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in       london           nothing of much importance  mr  holmes  only a joke  as like as       not  it was this letter  if you can call it a letter  which       reached me this morning          he laid an envelope upon the table  and we all bent over it  it       was of common quality  greyish in colour  the address   sir henry       baskerville  northumberland hotel   was printed in rough       characters  the post mark  charing cross   and the date of       posting the preceding evening          who knew that you were going to the northumberland hotel   asked       holmes  glancing keenly across at our visitor          no one could have known  we only decided after i met dr        mortimer           but dr  mortimer was no doubt already stopping there           no  i had been staying with a friend   said the doctor          there was no possible indication that we intended to go to this       hotel           hum  someone seems to be very deeply interested in your       movements   out of the envelope he took a half sheet of foolscap       paper folded into four  this he opened and spread flat upon the       table  across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed       by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it  it ran           as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor         the word  moor  only was printed in ink          now   said sir henry baskerville   perhaps you will tell me  mr        holmes  what in thunder is the meaning of that  and who it is       that takes so much interest in my affairs           what do you make of it  dr  mortimer  you must allow that there       is nothing supernatural about this  at any rate           no  sir  but it might very well come from someone who was       convinced that the business is supernatural           what business   asked sir henry sharply   it seems to me that       all you gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own       affairs           you shall share our knowledge before you leave this room  sir       henry  i promise you that   said sherlock holmes   we will       confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this       very interesting document  which must have been put together and       posted yesterday evening  have you yesterday s  times   watson           it is here in the corner           might i trouble you for it the inside page  please  with the       leading articles   he glanced swiftly over it  running his eyes       up and down the columns   capital article this on free trade        permit me to give you an extract from it         you may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or      your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff  but      it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run      keep away wealth from the country  diminish the value of our      imports  and lower the general conditions of life in this island           what do you think of that  watson   cried holmes in high glee        rubbing his hands together with satisfaction   don t you think       that is an admirable sentiment          dr  mortimer looked at holmes with an air of professional       interest  and sir henry baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark       eyes upon me          i don t know much about the tariff and things of that kind         said he   but it seems to me we ve got a bit off the trail so far       as that note is concerned           on the contrary  i think we are particularly hot upon the trail        sir henry  watson here knows more about my methods than you do        but i fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of       this sentence           no  i confess that i see no connection           and yet  my dear watson  there is so very close a connection       that the one is extracted out of the other   you    your          your    life    reason    value    keep away    from the   don t       you see now whence these words have been taken           by thunder  you re right  well  if that isn t smart   cried sir       henry          if any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that        keep away  and  from the  are cut out in one piece           well  now so it is           really  mr  holmes  this exceeds anything which i could have       imagined   said dr  mortimer  gazing at my friend in amazement         i could understand anyone saying that the words were from a       newspaper  but that you should name which  and add that it came       from the leading article  is really one of the most remarkable       things which i have ever known  how did you do it           i presume  doctor  that you could tell the skull of a negro from       that of an esquimau           most certainly           but how           because that is my special hobby  the differences are obvious        the supra orbital crest  the facial angle  the maxillary curve        the           but this is my special hobby  and the differences are equally       obvious  there is as much difference to my eyes between the       leaded bourgeois type of a  times  article and the slovenly print       of an evening half penny paper as there could be between your       negro and your esquimau  the detection of types is one of the       most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in       crime  though i confess that once when i was very young i       confused the  leeds mercury  with the  western morning news   but       a  times  leader is entirely distinctive  and these words could       have been taken from nothing else  as it was done yesterday the       strong probability was that we should find the words in       yesterday s issue           so far as i can follow you  then  mr  holmes   said sir henry       baskerville   someone cut out this message with a scissors           nail scissors   said holmes   you can see that it was a very       short bladed scissors  since the cutter had to take two snips       over  keep away            that is so  someone  then  cut out the message with a pair of       short bladed scissors  pasted it with paste           gum   said holmes          with gum on to the paper  but i want to know why the word  moor        should have been written           because he could not find it in print  the other words were all       simple and might be found in any issue  but  moor  would be less       common           why  of course  that would explain it  have you read anything       else in this message  mr  holmes           there are one or two indications  and yet the utmost pains have       been taken to remove all clues  the address  you observe is       printed in rough characters  but the  times  is a paper which is       seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated  we       may take it  therefore  that the letter was composed by an       educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one  and his       effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing       might be known  or come to be known  by you  again  you will       observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line  but       that some are much higher than others   life   for example is       quite out of its proper place  that may point to carelessness or       it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter        on the whole i incline to the latter view  since the matter was       evidently important  and it is unlikely that the composer of such       a letter would be careless  if he were in a hurry it opens up the       interesting question why he should be in a hurry  since any       letter posted up to early morning would reach sir henry before he       would leave his hotel  did the composer fear an interruption and       from whom           we are coming now rather into the region of guesswork   said dr        mortimer          say  rather  into the region where we balance probabilities and       choose the most likely  it is the scientific use of the       imagination  but we have always some material basis on which to       start our speculation  now  you would call it a guess  no doubt        but i am almost certain that this address has been written in a       hotel           how in the world can you say that           if you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and       the ink have given the writer trouble  the pen has spluttered       twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short       address  showing that there was very little ink in the bottle        now  a private pen or ink bottle is seldom allowed to be in such       a state  and the combination of the two must be quite rare  but       you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen  where it is rare to get       anything else  yes  i have very little hesitation in saying that       could we examine the waste paper baskets of the hotels around       charing cross until we found the remains of the mutilated  times        leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent       this singular message  halloa  halloa  what s this          he was carefully examining the foolscap  upon which the words       were pasted  holding it only an inch or two from his eyes          well           nothing   said he  throwing it down   it is a blank half sheet       of paper  without even a water mark upon it  i think we have       drawn as much as we can from this curious letter  and now  sir       henry  has anything else of interest happened to you since you       have been in london           why  no  mr  holmes  i think not           you have not observed anyone follow or watch you           i seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel         said our visitor   why in thunder should anyone follow or watch       me           we are coming to that  you have nothing else to report to us       before we go into this matter           well  it depends upon what you think worth reporting           i think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth       reporting          sir henry smiled   i don t know much of british life yet  for i       have spent nearly all my time in the states and in canada  but i       hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary       routine of life over here           you have lost one of your boots           my dear sir   cried dr  mortimer   it is only mislaid  you will       find it when you return to the hotel  what is the use of       troubling mr  holmes with trifles of this kind           well  he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine           exactly   said holmes   however foolish the incident may seem        you have lost one of your boots  you say           well  mislaid it  anyhow  i put them both outside my door last       night  and there was only one in the morning  i could get no       sense out of the chap who cleans them  the worst of it is that i       only bought the pair last night in the strand  and i have never       had them on           if you have never worn them  why did you put them out to be       cleaned           they were tan boots and had never been varnished  that was why i       put them out           then i understand that on your arrival in london yesterday you       went out at once and bought a pair of boots           i did a good deal of shopping  dr  mortimer here went round with       me  you see  if i am to be squire down there i must dress the       part  and it may be that i have got a little careless in my ways       out west  among other things i bought these brown boots gave six       dollars for them and had one stolen before ever i had them on my       feet           it seems a singularly useless thing to steal   said sherlock       holmes   i confess that i share dr  mortimer s belief that it       will not be long before the missing boot is found           and  now  gentlemen   said the baronet with decision   it seems       to me that i have spoken quite enough about the little that i       know  it is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full       account of what we are all driving at           your request is a very reasonable one   holmes answered   dr        mortimer  i think you could not do better than to tell your story       as you told it to us          thus encouraged  our scientific friend drew his papers from his       pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the       morning before  sir henry baskerville listened with the deepest       attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise          well  i seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance         said he when the long narrative was finished   of course  i ve       heard of the hound ever since i was in the nursery  it s the pet       story of the family  though i never thought of taking it       seriously before  but as to my uncle s death well  it all seems       boiling up in my head  and i can t get it clear yet  you don t       seem quite to have made up your mind whether it s a case for a       policeman or a clergyman           precisely           and now there s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel  i       suppose that fits into its place           it seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what       goes on upon the moor   said dr  mortimer          and also   said holmes   that someone is not ill disposed       towards you  since they warn you of danger           or it may be that they wish  for their own purposes  to scare me       away           well  of course  that is possible also  i am very much indebted       to you  dr  mortimer  for introducing me to a problem which       presents several interesting alternatives  but the practical       point which we now have to decide  sir henry  is whether it is or       is not advisable for you to go to baskerville hall           why should i not go           there seems to be danger           do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger       from human beings           well  that is what we have to find out           whichever it is  my answer is fixed  there is no devil in hell        mr  holmes  and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me       from going to the home of my own people  and you may take that to       be my final answer   his dark brows knitted and his face flushed       to a dusky red as he spoke  it was evident that the fiery temper       of the baskervilles was not extinct in this their last       representative   meanwhile   said he   i have hardly had time to       think over all that you have told me  it s a big thing for a man       to have to understand and to decide at one sitting  i should like       to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind  now  look       here  mr  holmes  it s half past eleven now and i am going back       right away to my hotel  suppose you and your friend  dr  watson        come round and lunch with us at two  i ll be able to tell you       more clearly then how this thing strikes me           is that convenient to you  watson           perfectly           then you may expect us  shall i have a cab called           i d prefer to walk  for this affair has flurried me rather           i ll join you in a walk  with pleasure   said his companion          then we meet again at two o clock  au revoir  and good morning          we heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang       of the front door  in an instant holmes had changed from the       languid dreamer to the man of action          your hat and boots  watson  quick  not a moment to lose   he       rushed into his room in his dressing gown and was back again in a       few seconds in a frock coat  we hurried together down the stairs       and into the street  dr  mortimer and baskerville were still       visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of       oxford street          shall i run on and stop them           not for the world  my dear watson  i am perfectly satisfied with       your company if you will tolerate mine  our friends are wise  for       it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk          he quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which       divided us by about half  then  still keeping a hundred yards       behind  we followed into oxford street and so down regent street        once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window  upon       which holmes did the same  an instant afterwards he gave a little       cry of satisfaction  and  following the direction of his eager       eyes  i saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted       on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward       again          there s our man  watson  come along  we ll have a good look at       him  if we can do no more          at that instant i was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of       piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab        instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up  something was screamed       to the driver  and the cab flew madly off down regent street        holmes looked eagerly round for another  but no empty one was in       sight  then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the       traffic  but the start was too great  and already the cab was out       of sight          there now   said holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white       with vexation from the tide of vehicles   was ever such bad luck       and such bad management  too  watson  watson  if you are an       honest man you will record this also and set it against my       successes           who was the man           i have not an idea           a spy           well  it was evident from what we have heard that baskerville       has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in       town  how else could it be known so quickly that it was the       northumberland hotel which he had chosen  if they had followed       him the first day i argued that they would follow him also the       second  you may have observed that i twice strolled over to the       window while dr  mortimer was reading his legend           yes  i remember           i was looking out for loiterers in the street  but i saw none        we are dealing with a clever man  watson  this matter cuts very       deep  and though i have not finally made up my mind whether it is       a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us  i       am conscious always of power and design  when our friends left i       at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their       invisible attendant  so wily was he that he had not trusted       himself upon foot  but he had availed himself of a cab so that he       could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice        his method had the additional advantage that if they were to take       a cab he was all ready to follow them  it has  however  one       obvious disadvantage           it puts him in the power of the cabman           exactly           what a pity we did not get the number           my dear watson  clumsy as i have been  you surely do not       seriously imagine that i neglected to get the number  no       is       our man  but that is no use to us for the moment           i fail to see how you could have done more           on observing the cab i should have instantly turned and walked       in the other direction  i should then at my leisure have hired a       second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance  or        better still  have driven to the northumberland hotel and waited       there  when our unknown had followed baskerville home we should       have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and       seeing where he made for  as it is  by an indiscreet eagerness        which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and       energy by our opponent  we have betrayed ourselves and lost our       man          we had been sauntering slowly down regent street during this       conversation  and dr  mortimer  with his companion  had long       vanished in front of us          there is no object in our following them   said holmes   the       shadow has departed and will not return  we must see what further       cards we have in our hands and play them with decision  could you       swear to that man s face within the cab           i could swear only to the beard           and so could i from which i gather that in all probability it       was a false one  a clever man upon so delicate an errand has no       use for a beard save to conceal his features  come in here        watson          he turned into one of the district messenger offices  where he       was warmly greeted by the manager          ah  wilson  i see you have not forgotten the little case in       which i had the good fortune to help you           no  sir  indeed i have not  you saved my good name  and perhaps       my life           my dear fellow  you exaggerate  i have some recollection        wilson  that you had among your boys a lad named cartwright  who       showed some ability during the investigation           yes  sir  he is still with us           could you ring him up  thank you  and i should be glad to have       change of this five pound note          a lad of fourteen  with a bright  keen face  had obeyed the       summons of the manager  he stood now gazing with great reverence       at the famous detective          let me have the hotel directory   said holmes   thank you  now        cartwright  there are the names of twenty three hotels here  all       in the immediate neighbourhood of charing cross  do you see           yes  sir           you will visit each of these in turn           yes  sir           you will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one       shilling  here are twenty three shillings           yes  sir           you will tell him that you want to see the waste paper of       yesterday  you will say that an important telegram has miscarried       and that you are looking for it  you understand           yes  sir           but what you are really looking for is the centre page of the        times  with some holes cut in it with scissors  here is a copy       of the  times   it is this page  you could easily recognize it        could you not           yes  sir           in each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter        to whom also you will give a shilling  here are twenty three       shillings  you will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of       the twenty three that the waste of the day before has been burned       or removed  in the three other cases you will be shown a heap of       paper and you will look for this page of the  times  among it        the odds are enormously against your finding it  there are ten       shillings over in case of emergencies  let me have a report by       wire at baker street before evening  and now  watson  it only       remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman        no        and then we will drop into one of the bond street       picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the       hotel      chapter     three broken threads        sherlock holmes had  in a very remarkable degree  the power of       detaching his mind at will  for two hours the strange business in       which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten  and he was       entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern belgian masters        he would talk of nothing but art  of which he had the crudest       ideas  from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at       the northumberland hotel          sir henry baskerville is upstairs expecting you   said the       clerk   he asked me to show you up at once when you came           have you any objection to my looking at your register   said       holmes          not in the least          the book showed that two names had been added after that of       baskerville  one was theophilus johnson and family  of newcastle        the other mrs  oldmore and maid  of high lodge  alton          surely that must be the same johnson whom i used to know   said       holmes to the porter   a lawyer  is he not  grey headed  and       walks with a limp           no  sir  this is mr  johnson  the coal owner  a very active       gentleman  not older than yourself           surely you are mistaken about his trade           no  sir  he has used this hotel for many years  and he is very       well known to us           ah  that settles it  mrs  oldmore  too  i seem to remember the       name  excuse my curiosity  but often in calling upon one friend       one finds another           she is an invalid lady  sir  her husband was once mayor of       gloucester  she always comes to us when she is in town           thank you  i am afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance  we have       established a most important fact by these questions  watson   he       continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together   we know       now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not       settled down in his own hotel  that means that while they are  as       we have seen  very anxious to watch him  they are equally anxious       that he should not see them  now  this is a most suggestive       fact           what does it suggest           it suggests halloa  my dear fellow  what on earth is the       matter          as we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against sir       henry baskerville himself  his face was flushed with anger  and       he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands  so furious was       he that he was hardly articulate  and when he did speak it was in       a much broader and more western dialect than any which we had       heard from him in the morning          seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel   he       cried   they ll find they ve started in to monkey with the wrong       man unless they are careful  by thunder  if that chap can t find       my missing boot there will be trouble  i can take a joke with the       best  mr  holmes  but they ve got a bit over the mark this time           still looking for your boot           yes  sir  and mean to find it           but  surely  you said that it was a new brown boot           so it was  sir  and now it s an old black one           what  you don t mean to say            that s just what i do mean to say  i only had three pairs in the       world the new brown  the old black  and the patent leathers        which i am wearing  last night they took one of my brown ones        and today they have sneaked one of the black  well  have you got       it  speak out  man  and don t stand staring          an agitated german waiter had appeared upon the scene          no  sir  i have made inquiry all over the hotel  but i can hear       no word of it           well  either that boot comes back before sundown or i ll see the       manager and tell him that i go right straight out of this hotel           it shall be found  sir i promise you that if you will have a       little patience it will be found           mind it is  for it s the last thing of mine that i ll lose in       this den of thieves  well  well  mr  holmes  you ll excuse my       troubling you about such a trifle           i think it s well worth troubling about           why  you look very serious over it           how do you explain it           i just don t attempt to explain it  it seems the very maddest        queerest thing that ever happened to me           the queerest perhaps   said holmes thoughtfully          what do you make of it yourself           well  i don t profess to understand it yet  this case of yours       is very complex  sir henry  when taken in conjunction with your       uncle s death i am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of       capital importance which i have handled there is one which cuts       so deep  but we hold several threads in our hands  and the odds       are that one or other of them guides us to the truth  we may       waste time in following the wrong one  but sooner or later we       must come upon the right          we had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the       business which had brought us together  it was in the private       sitting room to which we afterwards repaired that holmes asked       baskerville what were his intentions          to go to baskerville hall           and when           at the end of the week           on the whole   said holmes   i think that your decision is a       wise one  i have ample evidence that you are being dogged in       london  and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult       to discover who these people are or what their object can be  if       their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief  and we       should be powerless to prevent it  you did not know  dr        mortimer  that you were followed this morning from my house          dr  mortimer started violently   followed  by whom           that  unfortunately  is what i cannot tell you  have you among       your neighbours or acquaintances on dartmoor any man with a       black  full beard           no or  let me see why  yes  barrymore  sir charles s butler  is       a man with a full  black beard           ha  where is barrymore           he is in charge of the hall           we had best ascertain if he is really there  or if by any       possibility he might be in london           how can you do that           give me a telegraph form   is all ready for sir henry   that       will do  address to mr  barrymore  baskerville hall  what is the       nearest telegraph office  grimpen  very good  we will send a       second wire to the postmaster  grimpen   telegram to mr        barrymore to be delivered into his own hand  if absent  please       return wire to sir henry baskerville  northumberland hotel   that       should let us know before evening whether barrymore is at his       post in devonshire or not           that s so   said baskerville   by the way  dr  mortimer  who is       this barrymore  anyhow           he is the son of the old caretaker  who is dead  they have       looked after the hall for four generations now  so far as i know        he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the       county           at the same time   said baskerville   it s clear enough that so       long as there are none of the family at the hall these people       have a mighty fine home and nothing to do           that is true           did barrymore profit at all by sir charles s will   asked       holmes          he and his wife had five hundred pounds each           ha  did they know that they would receive this           yes  sir charles was very fond of talking about the provisions       of his will           that is very interesting           i hope   said dr  mortimer   that you do not look with       suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from sir       charles  for i also had a thousand pounds left to me           indeed  and anyone else           there were many insignificant sums to individuals  and a large       number of public charities  the residue all went to sir henry           and how much was the residue           seven hundred and forty thousand pounds          holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise   i had no idea that so       gigantic a sum was involved   said he          sir charles had the reputation of being rich  but we did not       know how very rich he was until we came to examine his       securities  the total value of the estate was close on to a       million           dear me  it is a stake for which a man might well play a       desperate game  and one more question  dr  mortimer  supposing       that anything happened to our young friend here you will forgive       the unpleasant hypothesis  who would inherit the estate           since rodger baskerville  sir charles s younger brother died       unmarried  the estate would descend to the desmonds  who are       distant cousins  james desmond is an elderly clergyman in       westmoreland           thank you  these details are all of great interest  have you met       mr  james desmond           yes  he once came down to visit sir charles  he is a man of       venerable appearance and of saintly life  i remember that he       refused to accept any settlement from sir charles  though he       pressed it upon him           and this man of simple tastes would be the heir to sir charles s       thousands           he would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed  he       would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed       otherwise by the present owner  who can  of course  do what he       likes with it           and have you made your will  sir henry           no  mr  holmes  i have not  i ve had no time  for it was only       yesterday that i learned how matters stood  but in any case i       feel that the money should go with the title and estate  that was       my poor uncle s idea  how is the owner going to restore the       glories of the baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up       the property  house  land  and dollars must go together           quite so  well  sir henry  i am of one mind with you as to the       advisability of your going down to devonshire without delay        there is only one provision which i must make  you certainly must       not go alone           dr  mortimer returns with me           but dr  mortimer has his practice to attend to  and his house is       miles away from yours  with all the goodwill in the world he may       be unable to help you  no  sir henry  you must take with you       someone  a trusty man  who will be always by your side           is it possible that you could come yourself  mr  holmes           if matters came to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in       person  but you can understand that  with my extensive consulting       practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many       quarters  it is impossible for me to be absent from london for an       indefinite time  at the present instant one of the most revered       names in england is being besmirched by a blackmailer  and only i       can stop a disastrous scandal  you will see how impossible it is       for me to go to dartmoor           whom would you recommend  then          holmes laid his hand upon my arm   if my friend would undertake       it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when       you are in a tight place  no one can say so more confidently than       i          the proposition took me completely by surprise  but before i had       time to answer  baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it       heartily          well  now  that is real kind of you  dr  watson   said he   you       see how it is with me  and you know just as much about the matter       as i do  if you will come down to baskerville hall and see me       through i ll never forget it          the promise of adventure had always a fascination for me  and i       was complimented by the words of holmes and by the eagerness with       which the baronet hailed me as a companion          i will come  with pleasure   said i   i do not know how i could       employ my time better           and you will report very carefully to me   said holmes   when a       crisis comes  as it will do  i will direct how you shall act  i       suppose that by saturday all might be ready           would that suit dr  watson           perfectly           then on saturday  unless you hear to the contrary  we shall meet       at the ten thirty train from paddington          we had risen to depart when baskerville gave a cry of triumph        and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown       boot from under a cabinet          my missing boot   he cried          may all our difficulties vanish as easily   said sherlock       holmes          but it is a very singular thing   dr  mortimer remarked   i       searched this room carefully before lunch           and so did i   said baskerville   every inch of it           there was certainly no boot in it then           in that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were       lunching          the german was sent for but professed to know nothing of the       matter  nor could any inquiry clear it up  another item had been       added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small       mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly  setting       aside the whole grim story of sir charles s death  we had a line       of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days        which included the receipt of the printed letter  the       black bearded spy in the hansom  the loss of the new brown boot        the loss of the old black boot  and now the return of the new       brown boot  holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to       baker street  and i knew from his drawn brows and keen face that       his mind  like my own  was busy in endeavouring to frame some       scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected       episodes could be fitted  all afternoon and late into the evening       he sat lost in tobacco and thought         just before dinner two telegrams were handed in  the first ran         have just heard that barrymore is at the hall  baskerville         the second         visited twenty three hotels as directed  but sorry to report       unable to trace cut sheet of  times   cartwright          there go two of my threads  watson  there is nothing more       stimulating than a case where everything goes against you  we       must cast round for another scent           we have still the cabman who drove the spy           exactly  i have wired to get his name and address from the       official registry  i should not be surprised if this were an       answer to my question          the ring at the bell proved to be something even more       satisfactory than an answer  however  for the door opened and a       rough looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself          i got a message from the head office that a gent at this address       had been inquiring for no         said he   i ve driven my cab       this seven years and never a word of complaint  i came here       straight from the yard to ask you to your face what you had       against me           i have nothing in the world against you  my good man   said       holmes   on the contrary  i have half a sovereign for you if you       will give me a clear answer to my questions           well  i ve had a good day and no mistake   said the cabman with       a grin   what was it you wanted to ask  sir           first of all your name and address  in case i want you again           john clayton    turpey street  the borough  my cab is out of       shipley s yard  near waterloo station          sherlock holmes made a note of it          now  clayton  tell me all about the fare who came and watched       this house at ten o clock this morning and afterwards followed       the two gentlemen down regent street          the man looked surprised and a little embarrassed   why  there s       no good my telling you things  for you seem to know as much as i       do already   said he   the truth is that the gentleman told me       that he was a detective and that i was to say nothing about him       to anyone           my good fellow  this is a very serious business  and you may       find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide       anything from me  you say that your fare told you that he was a       detective           yes  he did           when did he say this           when he left me           did he say anything more           he mentioned his name          holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me   oh  he mentioned       his name  did he  that was imprudent  what was the name that he       mentioned           his name   said the cabman   was mr  sherlock holmes          never have i seen my friend more completely taken aback than by       the cabman s reply  for an instant he sat in silent amazement        then he burst into a hearty laugh          a touch  watson an undeniable touch   said he   i feel a foil as       quick and supple as my own  he got home upon me very prettily       that time  so his name was sherlock holmes  was it           yes  sir  that was the gentleman s name           excellent  tell me where you picked him up and all that       occurred           he hailed me at half past nine in trafalgar square  he said that       he was a detective  and he offered me two guineas if i would do       exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions  i was glad       enough to agree  first we drove down to the northumberland hotel       and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from       the rank  we followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near       here           this very door   said holmes          well  i couldn t be sure of that  but i dare say my fare knew       all about it  we pulled up halfway down the street and waited an       hour and a half  then the two gentlemen passed us  walking  and       we followed down baker street and along           i know   said holmes          until we got three quarters down regent street  then my       gentleman threw up the trap  and he cried that i should drive       right away to waterloo station as hard as i could go  i whipped       up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes  then he paid       up his two guineas  like a good one  and away he went into the       station  only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said         it might interest you to know that you have been driving mr        sherlock holmes   that s how i come to know the name           i see  and you saw no more of him           not after he went into the station           and how would you describe mr  sherlock holmes          the cabman scratched his head   well  he wasn t altogether such       an easy gentleman to describe  i d put him at forty years of age        and he was of a middle height  two or three inches shorter than       you  sir  he was dressed like a toff  and he had a black beard        cut square at the end  and a pale face  i don t know as i could       say more than that           colour of his eyes           no  i can t say that           nothing more that you can remember           no  sir  nothing           well  then  here is your half sovereign  there s another one       waiting for you if you can bring any more information        good night           good night  sir  and thank you          john clayton departed chuckling  and holmes turned to me with a       shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile          snap goes our third thread  and we end where we began   said he         the cunning rascal  he knew our number  knew that sir henry       baskerville had consulted me  spotted who i was in regent street        conjectured that i had got the number of the cab and would lay my       hands on the driver  and so sent back this audacious message  i       tell you  watson  this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of       our steel  i ve been checkmated in london  i can only wish you       better luck in devonshire  but i m not easy in my mind about it           about what           about sending you  it s an ugly business  watson  an ugly       dangerous business  and the more i see of it the less i like it        yes  my dear fellow  you may laugh  but i give you my word that i       shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in baker       street once more      chapter     baskerville hall        sir henry baskerville and dr  mortimer were ready upon the       appointed day  and we started as arranged for devonshire  mr        sherlock holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last       parting injunctions and advice          i will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions        watson   said he   i wish you simply to report facts in the       fullest possible manner to me  and you can leave me to do the       theorizing           what sort of facts   i asked          anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon       the case  and especially the relations between young baskerville       and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death       of sir charles  i have made some inquiries myself in the last few       days  but the results have  i fear  been negative  one thing only       appears to be certain  and that is that mr  james desmond  who is       the next heir  is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable       disposition  so that this persecution does not arise from him  i       really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our       calculations  there remain the people who will actually surround       sir henry baskerville upon the moor           would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this       barrymore couple           by no means  you could not make a greater mistake  if they are       innocent it would be a cruel injustice  and if they are guilty we       should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them  no        no  we will preserve them upon our list of suspects  then there       is a groom at the hall  if i remember right  there are two       moorland farmers  there is our friend dr  mortimer  whom i       believe to be entirely honest  and there is his wife  of whom we       know nothing  there is this naturalist  stapleton  and there is       his sister  who is said to be a young lady of attractions  there       is mr  frankland  of lafter hall  who is also an unknown factor        and there are one or two other neighbours  these are the folk who       must be your very special study           i will do my best           you have arms  i suppose           yes  i thought it as well to take them           most certainly  keep your revolver near you night and day  and       never relax your precautions          our friends had already secured a first class carriage and were       waiting for us upon the platform          no  we have no news of any kind   said dr  mortimer in answer to       my friend s questions   i can swear to one thing  and that is       that we have not been shadowed during the last two days  we have       never gone out without keeping a sharp watch  and no one could       have escaped our notice           you have always kept together  i presume           except yesterday afternoon  i usually give up one day to pure       amusement when i come to town  so i spent it at the museum of the       college of surgeons           and i went to look at the folk in the park   said baskerville          but we had no trouble of any kind           it was imprudent  all the same   said holmes  shaking his head       and looking very grave   i beg  sir henry  that you will not go       about alone  some great misfortune will befall you if you do  did       you get your other boot           no  sir  it is gone forever           indeed  that is very interesting  well  good bye   he added as       the train began to glide down the platform   bear in mind  sir       henry  one of the phrases in that queer old legend which dr        mortimer has read to us  and avoid the moor in those hours of       darkness when the powers of evil are exalted          i looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and       saw the tall  austere figure of holmes standing motionless and       gazing after us         the journey was a swift and pleasant one  and i spent it in       making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in       playing with dr  mortimer s spaniel  in a very few hours the       brown earth had become ruddy  the brick had changed to granite        and red cows grazed in well hedged fields where the lush grasses       and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer  if a damper        climate  young baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and       cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features       of the devon scenery          i ve been over a good part of the world since i left it  dr        watson   said he   but i have never seen a place to compare with       it           i never saw a devonshire man who did not swear by his county   i       remarked          it depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the       county   said dr  mortimer   a glance at our friend here reveals       the rounded head of the celt  which carries inside it the celtic       enthusiasm and power of attachment  poor sir charles s head was       of a very rare type  half gaelic  half ivernian in its       characteristics  but you were very young when you last saw       baskerville hall  were you not           i was a boy in my teens at the time of my father s death and had       never seen the hall  for he lived in a little cottage on the       south coast  thence i went straight to a friend in america  i       tell you it is all as new to me as it is to dr  watson  and i m       as keen as possible to see the moor           are you  then your wish is easily granted  for there is your       first sight of the moor   said dr  mortimer  pointing out of the       carriage window         over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood       there rose in the distance a grey  melancholy hill  with a       strange jagged summit  dim and vague in the distance  like some       fantastic landscape in a dream  baskerville sat for a long time        his eyes fixed upon it  and i read upon his eager face how much       it meant to him  this first sight of that strange spot where the       men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so       deep  there he sat  with his tweed suit and his american accent        in the corner of a prosaic railway carriage  and yet as i looked       at his dark and expressive face i felt more than ever how true a       descendant he was of that long line of high blooded  fiery  and       masterful men  there were pride  valour  and strength in his       thick brows  his sensitive nostrils  and his large hazel eyes  if       on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should       lie before us  this was at least a comrade for whom one might       venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely       share it         the train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all       descended  outside  beyond the low  white fence  a wagonette with       a pair of cobs was waiting  our coming was evidently a great       event  for station master and porters clustered round us to carry       out our luggage  it was a sweet  simple country spot  but i was       surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly       men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and       glanced keenly at us as we passed  the coachman  a hard faced        gnarled little fellow  saluted sir henry baskerville  and in a       few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad  white road        rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us  and old       gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage  but       behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever  dark       against the evening sky  the long  gloomy curve of the moor        broken by the jagged and sinister hills         the wagonette swung round into a side road  and we curved upward       through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels  high banks on       either side  heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart s tongue       ferns  bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light       of the sinking sun  still steadily rising  we passed over a       narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed       swiftly down  foaming and roaring amid the grey boulders  both       road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak       and fir  at every turn baskerville gave an exclamation of       delight  looking eagerly about him and asking countless       questions  to his eyes all seemed beautiful  but to me a tinge of       melancholy lay upon the countryside  which bore so clearly the       mark of the waning year  yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and       fluttered down upon us as we passed  the rattle of our wheels       died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation sad       gifts  as it seemed to me  for nature to throw before the       carriage of the returning heir of the baskervilles          halloa   cried dr  mortimer   what is this          a steep curve of heath clad land  an outlying spur of the moor        lay in front of us  on the summit  hard and clear like an       equestrian statue upon its pedestal  was a mounted soldier  dark       and stern  his rifle poised ready over his forearm  he was       watching the road along which we travelled          what is this  perkins   asked dr  mortimer         our driver half turned in his seat   there s a convict escaped       from princetown  sir  he s been out three days now  and the       warders watch every road and every station  but they ve had no       sight of him yet  the farmers about here don t like it  sir  and       that s a fact           well  i understand that they get five pounds if they can give       information           yes  sir  but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing       compared to the chance of having your throat cut  you see  it       isn t like any ordinary convict  this is a man that would stick       at nothing           who is he  then           it is selden  the notting hill murderer          i remembered the case well  for it was one in which holmes had       taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the       crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions       of the assassin  the commutation of his death sentence had been       due to some doubts as to his complete sanity  so atrocious was       his conduct  our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us       rose the huge expanse of the moor  mottled with gnarled and       craggy cairns and tors  a cold wind swept down from it and set us       shivering  somewhere there  on that desolate plain  was lurking       this fiendish man  hiding in a burrow like a wild beast  his       heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast       him out  it needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness       of the barren waste  the chilling wind  and the darkling sky        even baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely       around him         we had left the fertile country behind and beneath us  we looked       back on it now  the slanting rays of a low sun turning the       streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new       turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands  the       road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and       olive slopes  sprinkled with giant boulders  now and then we       passed a moorland cottage  walled and roofed with stone  with no       creeper to break its harsh outline  suddenly we looked down into       a cuplike depression  patched with stunted oaks and firs which       had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm  two       high  narrow towers rose over the trees  the driver pointed with       his whip          baskerville hall   said he         its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and       shining eyes  a few minutes later we had reached the lodge gates        a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron  with weather bitten       pillars on either side  blotched with lichens  and surmounted by       the boars  heads of the baskervilles  the lodge was a ruin of       black granite and bared ribs of rafters  but facing it was a new       building  half constructed  the first fruit of sir charles s       south african gold         through the gateway we passed into the avenue  where the wheels       were again hushed amid the leaves  and the old trees shot their       branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads  baskerville shuddered       as he looked up the long  dark drive to where the house glimmered       like a ghost at the farther end          was it here   he asked in a low voice          no  no  the yew alley is on the other side          the young heir glanced round with a gloomy face          it s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in       such a place as this   said he   it s enough to scare any man        i ll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months        and you won t know it again  with a thousand candle power swan       and edison right here in front of the hall door          the avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf  and the house lay       before us  in the fading light i could see that the centre was a       heavy block of building from which a porch projected  the whole       front was draped in ivy  with a patch clipped bare here and there       where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil        from this central block rose the twin towers  ancient        crenelated  and pierced with many loopholes  to right and left of       the turrets were more modern wings of black granite  a dull light       shone through heavy mullioned windows  and from the high chimneys       which rose from the steep  high angled roof there sprang a single       black column of smoke          welcome  sir henry  welcome to baskerville hall          a tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the       door of the wagonette  the figure of a woman was silhouetted       against the yellow light of the hall  she came out and helped the       man to hand down our bags          you don t mind my driving straight home  sir henry   said dr        mortimer   my wife is expecting me           surely you will stay and have some dinner           no  i must go  i shall probably find some work awaiting me  i       would stay to show you over the house  but barrymore will be a       better guide than i  good bye  and never hesitate night or day to       send for me if i can be of service          the wheels died away down the drive while sir henry and i turned       into the hall  and the door clanged heavily behind us  it was a       fine apartment in which we found ourselves  large  lofty  and       heavily raftered with huge baulks of age blackened oak  in the       great old fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a       log fire crackled and snapped  sir henry and i held out our hands       to it  for we were numb from our long drive  then we gazed round       us at the high  thin window of old stained glass  the oak       panelling  the stags  heads  the coats of arms upon the walls        all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp          it s just as i imagined it   said sir henry   is it not the very       picture of an old family home  to think that this should be the       same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived        it strikes me solemn to think of it          i saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed       about him  the light beat upon him where he stood  but long       shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above       him  barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms        he stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a       well trained servant  he was a remarkable looking man  tall        handsome  with a square black beard and pale  distinguished       features          would you wish dinner to be served at once  sir           is it ready           in a very few minutes  sir  you will find hot water in your       rooms  my wife and i will be happy  sir henry  to stay with you       until you have made your fresh arrangements  but you will       understand that under the new conditions this house will require       a considerable staff           what new conditions           i only meant  sir  that sir charles led a very retired life  and       we were able to look after his wants  you would  naturally  wish       to have more company  and so you will need changes in your       household           do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave           only when it is quite convenient to you  sir           but your family have been with us for several generations  have       they not  i should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an       old family connection          i seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler s white       face          i feel that also  sir  and so does my wife  but to tell the       truth  sir  we were both very much attached to sir charles  and       his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very       painful to us  i fear that we shall never again be easy in our       minds at baskerville hall           but what do you intend to do           i have no doubt  sir  that we shall succeed in establishing       ourselves in some business  sir charles s generosity has given us       the means to do so  and now  sir  perhaps i had best show you to       your rooms          a square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall        approached by a double stair  from this central point two long       corridors extended the whole length of the building  from which       all the bedrooms opened  my own was in the same wing as       baskerville s and almost next door to it  these rooms appeared to       be much more modern than the central part of the house  and the       bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the       sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind         but the dining room which opened out of the hall was a place of       shadow and gloom  it was a long chamber with a step separating       the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for       their dependents  at one end a minstrel s gallery overlooked it        black beams shot across above our heads  with a smoke darkened       ceiling beyond them  with rows of flaring torches to light it up        and the colour and rude hilarity of an old time banquet  it might       have softened  but now  when two black clothed gentlemen sat in       the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp  one s voice       became hushed and one s spirit subdued  a dim line of ancestors        in every variety of dress  from the elizabethan knight to the       buck of the regency  stared down upon us and daunted us by their       silent company  we talked little  and i for one was glad when the       meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern       billiard room and smoke a cigarette          my word  it isn t a very cheerful place   said sir henry   i       suppose one can tone down to it  but i feel a bit out of the       picture at present  i don t wonder that my uncle got a little       jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this  however  if       it suits you  we will retire early tonight  and perhaps things       may seem more cheerful in the morning          i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from       my window  it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of       the hall door  beyond  two copses of trees moaned and swung in a       rising wind  a half moon broke through the rifts of racing       clouds  in its cold light i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe       of rocks  and the long  low curve of the melancholy moor  i       closed the curtain  feeling that my last impression was in       keeping with the rest         and yet it was not quite the last  i found myself weary and yet       wakeful  tossing restlessly from side to side  seeking for the       sleep which would not come  far away a chiming clock struck out       the quarters of the hours  but otherwise a deathly silence lay       upon the old house  and then suddenly  in the very dead of the       night  there came a sound to my ears  clear  resonant  and       unmistakable  it was the sob of a woman  the muffled  strangling       gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow  i sat up in       bed and listened intently  the noise could not have been far away       and was certainly in the house  for half an hour i waited with       every nerve on the alert  but there came no other sound save the       chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall     chapter     the stapletons of merripit house        the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface       from our minds the grim and grey impression which had been left       upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall  as       sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through       the high mullioned windows  throwing watery patches of colour       from the coats of arms which covered them  the dark panelling       glowed like bronze in the golden rays  and it was hard to realise       that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom       into our souls upon the evening before          i guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to       blame   said the baronet   we were tired with our journey and       chilled by our drive  so we took a grey view of the place  now we       are fresh and well  so it is all cheerful once more           and yet it was not entirely a question of imagination   i       answered   did you  for example  happen to hear someone  a woman       i think  sobbing in the night           that is curious  for i did when i was half asleep fancy that i       heard something of the sort  i waited quite a time  but there was       no more of it  so i concluded that it was all a dream           i heard it distinctly  and i am sure that it was really the sob       of a woman           we must ask about this right away   he rang the bell and asked       barrymore whether he could account for our experience  it seemed       to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler       still as he listened to his master s question          there are only two women in the house  sir henry   he answered         one is the scullery maid  who sleeps in the other wing  the       other is my wife  and i can answer for it that the sound could       not have come from her          and yet he lied as he said it  for it chanced that after       breakfast i met mrs  barrymore in the long corridor with the sun       full upon her face  she was a large  impassive  heavy featured       woman with a stern set expression of mouth  but her telltale eyes       were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids  it was she        then  who wept in the night  and if she did so her husband must       know it  yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in       declaring that it was not so  why had he done this  and why did       she weep so bitterly  already round this pale faced  handsome        black bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery       and of gloom  it was he who had been the first to discover the       body of sir charles  and we had only his word for all the       circumstances which led up to the old man s death  was it       possible that it was barrymore  after all  whom we had seen in       the cab in regent street  the beard might well have been the       same  the cabman had described a somewhat shorter man  but such       an impression might easily have been erroneous  how could i       settle the point forever  obviously the first thing to do was to       see the grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had       really been placed in barrymore s own hands  be the answer what       it might  i should at least have something to report to sherlock       holmes         sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast  so that       the time was propitious for my excursion  it was a pleasant walk       of four miles along the edge of the moor  leading me at last to a       small grey hamlet  in which two larger buildings  which proved to       be the inn and the house of dr  mortimer  stood high above the       rest  the postmaster  who was also the village grocer  had a       clear recollection of the telegram          certainly  sir   said he   i had the telegram delivered to mr        barrymore exactly as directed           who delivered it           my boy here  james  you delivered that telegram to mr  barrymore       at the hall last week  did you not           yes  father  i delivered it           into his own hands   i asked          well  he was up in the loft at the time  so that i could not put       it into his own hands  but i gave it into mrs  barrymore s hands        and she promised to deliver it at once           did you see mr  barrymore           no  sir  i tell you he was in the loft           if you didn t see him  how do you know he was in the loft           well  surely his own wife ought to know where he is   said the       postmaster testily   didn t he get the telegram  if there is any       mistake it is for mr  barrymore himself to complain          it seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther  but it was       clear that in spite of holmes s ruse we had no proof that       barrymore had not been in london all the time  suppose that it       were so suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen       sir charles alive  and the first to dog the new heir when he       returned to england  what then  was he the agent of others or had       he some sinister design of his own  what interest could he have       in persecuting the baskerville family  i thought of the strange       warning clipped out of the leading article of the  times   was       that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was       bent upon counteracting his schemes  the only conceivable motive       was that which had been suggested by sir henry  that if the       family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home       would be secured for the barrymores  but surely such an       explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the       deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible       net round the young baronet  holmes himself had said that no more       complex case had come to him in all the long series of his       sensational investigations  i prayed  as i walked back along the       grey  lonely road  that my friend might soon be freed from his       preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of       responsibility from my shoulders         suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running       feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name  i turned        expecting to see dr  mortimer  but to my surprise it was a       stranger who was pursuing me  he was a small  slim  clean shaven        prim faced man  flaxen haired and lean jawed  between thirty and       forty years of age  dressed in a grey suit and wearing a straw       hat  a tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and       he carried a green butterfly net in one of his hands          you will  i am sure  excuse my presumption  dr  watson   said he       as he came panting up to where i stood   here on the moor we are       homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions  you may       possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend  mortimer  i       am stapleton  of merripit house           your net and box would have told me as much   said i   for i       knew that mr  stapleton was a naturalist  but how did you know       me           i have been calling on mortimer  and he pointed you out to me       from the window of his surgery as you passed  as our road lay the       same way i thought that i would overtake you and introduce       myself  i trust that sir henry is none the worse for his       journey           he is very well  thank you           we were all rather afraid that after the sad death of sir       charles the new baronet might refuse to live here  it is asking       much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of       this kind  but i need not tell you that it means a very great       deal to the countryside  sir henry has  i suppose  no       superstitious fears in the matter           i do not think that it is likely           of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the       family           i have heard it           it is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here        any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a       creature upon the moor   he spoke with a smile  but i seemed to       read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously   the       story took a great hold upon the imagination of sir charles  and       i have no doubt that it led to his tragic end           but how           his nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog       might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart  i fancy       that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night       in the yew alley  i feared that some disaster might occur  for i       was very fond of the old man  and i knew that his heart was       weak           how did you know that           my friend mortimer told me           you think  then  that some dog pursued sir charles  and that he       died of fright in consequence           have you any better explanation           i have not come to any conclusion           has mr  sherlock holmes          the words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the       placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no       surprise was intended          it is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you  dr        watson   said he   the records of your detective have reached us       here  and you could not celebrate him without being known       yourself  when mortimer told me your name he could not deny your       identity  if you are here  then it follows that mr  sherlock       holmes is interesting himself in the matter  and i am naturally       curious to know what view he may take           i am afraid that i cannot answer that question           may i ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself           he cannot leave town at present  he has other cases which engage       his attention           what a pity  he might throw some light on that which is so dark       to us  but as to your own researches  if there is any possible       way in which i can be of service to you i trust that you will       command me  if i had any indication of the nature of your       suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case  i might       perhaps even now give you some aid or advice           i assure you that i am simply here upon a visit to my friend        sir henry  and that i need no help of any kind           excellent   said stapleton   you are perfectly right to be wary       and discreet  i am justly reproved for what i feel was an       unjustifiable intrusion  and i promise you that i will not       mention the matter again          we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from       the road and wound away across the moor  a steep        boulder sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone       days been cut into a granite quarry  the face which was turned       towards us formed a dark cliff  with ferns and brambles growing       in its niches  from over a distant rise there floated a grey       plume of smoke          a moderate walk along this moor path brings us to merripit       house   said he   perhaps you will spare an hour that i may have       the pleasure of introducing you to my sister          my first thought was that i should be by sir henry s side  but       then i remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his       study table was littered  it was certain that i could not help       with those  and holmes had expressly said that i should study the       neighbours upon the moor  i accepted stapleton s invitation  and       we turned together down the path          it is a wonderful place  the moor   said he  looking round over       the undulating downs  long green rollers  with crests of jagged       granite foaming up into fantastic surges   you never tire of the       moor  you cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains        it is so vast  and so barren  and so mysterious           you know it well  then           i have only been here two years  the residents would call me a       newcomer  we came shortly after sir charles settled  but my       tastes led me to explore every part of the country round  and i       should think that there are few men who know it better than i       do           is it hard to know           very hard  you see  for example  this great plain to the north       here with the queer hills breaking out of it  do you observe       anything remarkable about that           it would be a rare place for a gallop           you would naturally think so and the thought has cost several       their lives before now  you notice those bright green spots       scattered thickly over it           yes  they seem more fertile than the rest          stapleton laughed   that is the great grimpen mire   said he   a       false step yonder means death to man or beast  only yesterday i       saw one of the moor ponies wander into it  he never came out  i       saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog hole        but it sucked him down at last  even in dry seasons it is a       danger to cross it  but after these autumn rains it is an awful       place  and yet i can find my way to the very heart of it and       return alive  by george  there is another of those miserable       ponies          something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges        then a long  agonised  writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful       cry echoed over the moor  it turned me cold with horror  but my       companion s nerves seemed to be stronger than mine          it s gone   said he   the mire has him  two in two days  and       many more  perhaps  for they get in the way of going there in the       dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them       in its clutches  it s a bad place  the great grimpen mire           and you say you can penetrate it           yes  there are one or two paths which a very active man can       take  i have found them out           but why should you wish to go into so horrible a place           well  you see the hills beyond  they are really islands cut off       on all sides by the impassable mire  which has crawled round them       in the course of years  that is where the rare plants and the       butterflies are  if you have the wit to reach them           i shall try my luck some day          he looked at me with a surprised face   for god s sake put such       an idea out of your mind   said he   your blood would be upon my       head  i assure you that there would not be the least chance of       your coming back alive  it is only by remembering certain complex       landmarks that i am able to do it           halloa   i cried   what is that          a long  low moan  indescribably sad  swept over the moor  it       filled the whole air  and yet it was impossible to say whence it       came  from a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar  and then       sank back into a melancholy  throbbing murmur once again        stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face          queer place  the moor   said he          but what is it           the peasants say it is the hound of the baskervilles calling for       its prey  i ve heard it once or twice before  but never quite so       loud          i looked round  with a chill of fear in my heart  at the huge       swelling plain  mottled with the green patches of rushes  nothing       stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens  which       croaked loudly from a tor behind us          you are an educated man  you don t believe such nonsense as       that   said i   what do you think is the cause of so strange a       sound           bogs make queer noises sometimes  it s the mud settling  or the       water rising  or something           no  no  that was a living voice           well  perhaps it was  did you ever hear a bittern booming           no  i never did           it s a very rare bird practically extinct in england now  but       all things are possible upon the moor  yes  i should not be       surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last       of the bitterns           it s the weirdest  strangest thing that ever i heard in my       life           yes  it s rather an uncanny place altogether  look at the       hillside yonder  what do you make of those          the whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings of       stone  a score of them at least          what are they  sheep pens           no  they are the homes of our worthy ancestors  prehistoric man       lived thickly on the moor  and as no one in particular has lived       there since  we find all his little arrangements exactly as he       left them  these are his wigwams with the roofs off  you can even       see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go       inside          but it is quite a town  when was it inhabited           neolithic man no date           what did he do           he grazed his cattle on these slopes  and he learned to dig for       tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe  look       at the great trench in the opposite hill  that is his mark  yes        you will find some very singular points about the moor  dr        watson  oh  excuse me an instant  it is surely cyclopides          a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path  and in an       instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed       in pursuit of it  to my dismay the creature flew straight for the       great mire  and my acquaintance never paused for an instant        bounding from tuft to tuft behind it  his green net waving in the       air  his grey clothes and jerky  zigzag  irregular progress made       him not unlike some huge moth himself  i was standing watching       his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary       activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the       treacherous mire  when i heard the sound of steps and  turning       round  found a woman near me upon the path  she had come from the       direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of       merripit house  but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was       quite close         i could not doubt that this was the miss stapleton of whom i had       been told  since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor        and i remembered that i had heard someone describe her as being a       beauty  the woman who approached me was certainly that  and of a       most uncommon type  there could not have been a greater contrast       between brother and sister  for stapleton was neutral tinted        with light hair and grey eyes  while she was darker than any       brunette whom i have seen in england slim  elegant  and tall  she       had a proud  finely cut face  so regular that it might have       seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the       beautiful dark  eager eyes  with her perfect figure and elegant       dress she was  indeed  a strange apparition upon a lonely       moorland path  her eyes were on her brother as i turned  and then       she quickened her pace towards me  i had raised my hat and was       about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned       all my thoughts into a new channel          go back   she said   go straight back to london  instantly          i could only stare at her in stupid surprise  her eyes blazed at       me  and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot          why should i go back   i asked          i cannot explain   she spoke in a low  eager voice  with a       curious lisp in her utterance   but for god s sake do what i ask       you  go back and never set foot upon the moor again           but i have only just come           man  man   she cried   can you not tell when a warning is for       your own good  go back to london  start tonight  get away from       this place at all costs  hush  my brother is coming  not a word       of what i have said  would you mind getting that orchid for me       among the mare s tails yonder  we are very rich in orchids on the       moor  though  of course  you are rather late to see the beauties       of the place          stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing       hard and flushed with his exertions          halloa  beryl   said he  and it seemed to me that the tone of       his greeting was not altogether a cordial one          well  jack  you are very hot           yes  i was chasing a cyclopides  he is very rare and seldom       found in the late autumn  what a pity that i should have missed       him   he spoke unconcernedly  but his small light eyes glanced       incessantly from the girl to me          you have introduced yourselves  i can see           yes  i was telling sir henry that it was rather late for him to       see the true beauties of the moor           why  who do you think this is           i imagine that it must be sir henry baskerville           no  no   said i   only a humble commoner  but his friend  my       name is dr  watson          a flush of vexation passed over her expressive face   we have       been talking at cross purposes   said she          why  you had not very much time for talk   her brother remarked       with the same questioning eyes          i talked as if dr  watson were a resident instead of being       merely a visitor   said she   it cannot much matter to him       whether it is early or late for the orchids  but you will come       on  will you not  and see merripit house          a short walk brought us to it  a bleak moorland house  once the       farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days  but now put into       repair and turned into a modern dwelling  an orchard surrounded       it  but the trees  as is usual upon the moor  were stunted and       nipped  and the effect of the whole place was mean and       melancholy  we were admitted by a strange  wizened  rusty coated       old manservant  who seemed in keeping with the house  inside        however  there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in       which i seemed to recognize the taste of the lady  as i looked       from their windows at the interminable granite flecked moor       rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon i could not but marvel       at what could have brought this highly educated man and this       beautiful woman to live in such a place          queer spot to choose  is it not   said he as if in answer to my       thought   and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy  do we       not  beryl           quite happy   said she  but there was no ring of conviction in       her words          i had a school   said stapleton   it was in the north country        the work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and       uninteresting  but the privilege of living with youth  of helping       to mould those young minds  and of impressing them with one s own       character and ideals was very dear to me  however  the fates were       against us  a serious epidemic broke out in the school and three       of the boys died  it never recovered from the blow  and much of       my capital was irretrievably swallowed up  and yet  if it were       not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys  i       could rejoice over my own misfortune  for  with my strong tastes       for botany and zoology  i find an unlimited field of work here        and my sister is as devoted to nature as i am  all this  dr        watson  has been brought upon your head by your expression as you       surveyed the moor out of our window           it certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little       dull less for you  perhaps  than for your sister           no  no  i am never dull   said she quickly          we have books  we have our studies  and we have interesting       neighbours  dr  mortimer is a most learned man in his own line        poor sir charles was also an admirable companion  we knew him       well and miss him more than i can tell  do you think that i       should intrude if i were to call this afternoon and make the       acquaintance of sir henry           i am sure that he would be delighted           then perhaps you would mention that i propose to do so  we may       in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him       until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings  will you       come upstairs  dr  watson  and inspect my collection of       lepidoptera  i think it is the most complete one in the       south west of england  by the time that you have looked through       them lunch will be almost ready          but i was eager to get back to my charge  the melancholy of the       moor  the death of the unfortunate pony  the weird sound which       had been associated with the grim legend of the baskervilles  all       these things tinged my thoughts with sadness  then on the top of       these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite       and distinct warning of miss stapleton  delivered with such       intense earnestness that i could not doubt that some grave and       deep reason lay behind it  i resisted all pressure to stay for       lunch  and i set off at once upon my return journey  taking the       grass grown path by which we had come         it seems  however  that there must have been some short cut for       those who knew it  for before i had reached the road i was       astounded to see miss stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side       of the track  her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions       and she held her hand to her side          i have run all the way in order to cut you off  dr  watson         said she   i had not even time to put on my hat  i must not stop        or my brother may miss me  i wanted to say to you how sorry i am       about the stupid mistake i made in thinking that you were sir       henry  please forget the words i said  which have no application       whatever to you           but i can t forget them  miss stapleton   said i   i am sir       henry s friend  and his welfare is a very close concern of mine        tell me why it was that you were so eager that sir henry should       return to london           a woman s whim  dr  watson  when you know me better you will       understand that i cannot always give reasons for what i say or       do           no  no  i remember the thrill in your voice  i remember the look       in your eyes  please  please  be frank with me  miss stapleton        for ever since i have been here i have been conscious of shadows       all round me  life has become like that great grimpen mire  with       little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with       no guide to point the track  tell me then what it was that you       meant  and i will promise to convey your warning to sir henry          an expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her       face  but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me          you make too much of it  dr  watson   said she   my brother and       i were very much shocked by the death of sir charles  we knew him       very intimately  for his favourite walk was over the moor to our       house  he was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the       family  and when this tragedy came i naturally felt that there       must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed  i was       distressed therefore when another member of the family came down       to live here  and i felt that he should be warned of the danger       which he will run  that was all which i intended to convey          but what is the danger           you know the story of the hound           i do not believe in such nonsense           but i do  if you have any influence with sir henry  take him       away from a place which has always been fatal to his family  the       world is wide  why should he wish to live at the place of       danger           because it  is  the place of danger  that is sir henry s nature        i fear that unless you can give me some more definite information       than this it would be impossible to get him to move           i cannot say anything definite  for i do not know anything       definite           i would ask you one more question  miss stapleton  if you meant       no more than this when you first spoke to me  why should you not       wish your brother to overhear what you said  there is nothing to       which he  or anyone else  could object           my brother is very anxious to have the hall inhabited  for he       thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor  he       would be very angry if he knew that i have said anything which       might induce sir henry to go away  but i have done my duty now       and i will say no more  i must go back  or he will miss me and       suspect that i have seen you  good bye   she turned and had       disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders  while       i  with my soul full of vague fears  pursued my way to       baskerville hall     chapter     first report of dr  watson        from this point onward i will follow the course of events by       transcribing my own letters to mr  sherlock holmes which lie       before me on the table  one page is missing  but otherwise they       are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the       moment more accurately than my memory  clear as it is upon these       tragic events  can possibly do         baskerville hall  october   th         my dear holmes         my previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to       date as to all that has occurred in this most god forsaken corner       of the world  the longer one stays here the more does the spirit       of the moor sink into one s soul  its vastness  and also its grim       charm  when you are once out upon its bosom you have left all       traces of modern england behind you  but  on the other hand  you       are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the       prehistoric people  on all sides of you as you walk are the       houses of these forgotten folk  with their graves and the huge       monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples  as you       look at their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides you       leave your own age behind you  and if you were to see a       skin clad  hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a       flint tipped arrow on to the string of his bow  you would feel       that his presence there was more natural than your own  the       strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what       must always have been most unfruitful soil  i am no antiquarian        but i could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried       race who were forced to accept that which none other would       occupy         all this  however  is foreign to the mission on which you sent me       and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely       practical mind  i can still remember your complete indifference       as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round       the sun  let me  therefore  return to the facts concerning sir       henry baskerville         if you have not had any report within the last few days it is       because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate        then a very surprising circumstance occurred  which i shall tell       you in due course  but  first of all  i must keep you in touch       with some of the other factors in the situation         one of these  concerning which i have said little  is the escaped       convict upon the moor  there is strong reason now to believe that       he has got right away  which is a considerable relief to the       lonely householders of this district  a fortnight has passed       since his flight  during which he has not been seen and nothing       has been heard of him  it is surely inconceivable that he could       have held out upon the moor during all that time  of course  so       far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all  any       one of these stone huts would give him a hiding place  but there       is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of       the moor sheep  we think  therefore  that he has gone  and the       outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence         we are four able bodied men in this household  so that we could       take good care of ourselves  but i confess that i have had uneasy       moments when i have thought of the stapletons  they live miles       from any help  there are one maid  an old manservant  the sister        and the brother  the latter not a very strong man  they would be       helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this notting       hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance  both sir henry       and i were concerned at their situation  and it was suggested       that perkins the groom should go over to sleep there  but       stapleton would not hear of it         the fact is that our friend  the baronet  begins to display a       considerable interest in our fair neighbour  it is not to be       wondered at  for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an       active man like him  and she is a very fascinating and beautiful       woman  there is something tropical and exotic about her which       forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother        yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires  he has certainly a       very marked influence over her  for i have seen her continually       glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what       she said  i trust that he is kind to her  there is a dry glitter       in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips  which goes with a       positive and possibly a harsh nature  you would find him an       interesting study         he came over to call upon baskerville on that first day  and the       very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the       legend of the wicked hugo is supposed to have had its origin  it       was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which       is so dismal that it might have suggested the story  we found a       short valley between rugged tors which led to an open  grassy       space flecked over with the white cotton grass  in the middle of       it rose two great stones  worn and sharpened at the upper end       until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous       beast  in every way it corresponded with the scene of the old       tragedy  sir henry was much interested and asked stapleton more       than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the       interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men  he spoke       lightly  but it was evident that he was very much in earnest        stapleton was guarded in his replies  but it was easy to see that       he said less than he might  and that he would not express his       whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the       baronet  he told us of similar cases  where families had suffered       from some evil influence  and he left us with the impression that       he shared the popular view upon the matter         on our way back we stayed for lunch at merripit house  and it was       there that sir henry made the acquaintance of miss stapleton        from the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly       attracted by her  and i am much mistaken if the feeling was not       mutual  he referred to her again and again on our walk home  and       since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen       something of the brother and sister  they dine here tonight  and       there is some talk of our going to them next week  one would       imagine that such a match would be very welcome to stapleton  and       yet i have more than once caught a look of the strongest       disapprobation in his face when sir henry has been paying some       attention to his sister  he is much attached to her  no doubt        and would lead a lonely life without her  but it would seem the       height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her       making so brilliant a marriage  yet i am certain that he does not       wish their intimacy to ripen into love  and i have several times       observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being        t te   t te   by the way  your instructions to me never to allow       sir henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a       love affair were to be added to our other difficulties  my       popularity would soon suffer if i were to carry out your orders       to the letter         the other day thursday  to be more exact dr  mortimer lunched       with us  he has been excavating a barrow at long down and has got       a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy  never was       there such a single minded enthusiast as he  the stapletons came       in afterwards  and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley       at sir henry s request to show us exactly how everything occurred       upon that fatal night  it is a long  dismal walk  the yew alley        between two high walls of clipped hedge  with a narrow band of       grass upon either side  at the far end is an old tumble down       summer house  halfway down is the moor gate  where the old       gentleman left his cigar ash  it is a white wooden gate with a       latch  beyond it lies the wide moor  i remembered your theory of       the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred  as the old       man stood there he saw something coming across the moor        something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran       and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion  there was       the long  gloomy tunnel down which he fled  and from what  a       sheep dog of the moor  or a spectral hound  black  silent  and       monstrous  was there a human agency in the matter  did the pale        watchful barrymore know more than he cared to say  it was all dim       and vague  but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind       it         one other neighbour i have met since i wrote last  this is mr        frankland  of lafter hall  who lives some four miles to the south       of us  he is an elderly man  red faced  white haired  and       choleric  his passion is for the british law  and he has spent a       large fortune in litigation  he fights for the mere pleasure of       fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a       question  so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly       amusement  sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the       parish to make him open it  at others he will with his own hands       tear down some other man s gate and declare that a path has       existed there from time immemorial  defying the owner to       prosecute him for trespass  he is learned in old manorial and       communal rights  and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour       of the villagers of fernworthy and sometimes against them  so       that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the       village street or else burned in effigy  according to his latest       exploit  he is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands       at present  which will probably swallow up the remainder of his       fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the       future  apart from the law he seems a kindly  good natured       person  and i only mention him because you were particular that i       should send some description of the people who surround us  he is       curiously employed at present  for  being an amateur astronomer        he has an excellent telescope  with which he lies upon the roof       of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of       catching a glimpse of the escaped convict  if he would confine       his energies to this all would be well  but there are rumours       that he intends to prosecute dr  mortimer for opening a grave       without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the       neolithic skull in the barrow on long down  he helps to keep our       lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where       it is badly needed         and now  having brought you up to date in the escaped convict        the stapletons  dr  mortimer  and frankland  of lafter hall  let       me end on that which is most important and tell you more about       the barrymores  and especially about the surprising development       of last night         first of all about the test telegram  which you sent from london       in order to make sure that barrymore was really here  i have       already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that       the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the       other  i told sir henry how the matter stood  and he at once  in       his downright fashion  had barrymore up and asked him whether he       had received the telegram himself  barrymore said that he had          did the boy deliver it into your own hands   asked sir henry         barrymore looked surprised  and considered for a little time          no   said he   i was in the box room at the time  and my wife       brought it up to me           did you answer it yourself           no  i told my wife what to answer and she went down to write       it          in the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord          i could not quite understand the object of your questions this       morning  sir henry   said he   i trust that they do not mean that       i have done anything to forfeit your confidence          sir henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by       giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe  the london       outfit having now all arrived         mrs  barrymore is of interest to me  she is a heavy  solid       person  very limited  intensely respectable  and inclined to be       puritanical  you could hardly conceive a less emotional subject        yet i have told you how  on the first night here  i heard her       sobbing bitterly  and since then i have more than once observed       traces of tears upon her face  some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her       heart  sometimes i wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts       her  and sometimes i suspect barrymore of being a domestic       tyrant  i have always felt that there was something singular and       questionable in this man s character  but the adventure of last       night brings all my suspicions to a head         and yet it may seem a small matter in itself  you are aware that       i am not a very sound sleeper  and since i have been on guard in       this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever  last night        about two in the morning  i was aroused by a stealthy step       passing my room  i rose  opened my door  and peeped out  a long       black shadow was trailing down the corridor  it was thrown by a       man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his       hand  he was in shirt and trousers  with no covering to his feet        i could merely see the outline  but his height told me that it       was barrymore  he walked very slowly and circumspectly  and there       was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole       appearance         i have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which       runs round the hall  but that it is resumed upon the farther       side  i waited until he had passed out of sight and then i       followed him  when i came round the balcony he had reached the       end of the farther corridor  and i could see from the glimmer of       light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms        now  all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his       expedition became more mysterious than ever  the light shone       steadily as if he were standing motionless  i crept down the       passage as noiselessly as i could and peeped round the corner of       the door         barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held       against the glass  his profile was half turned towards me  and       his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out       into the blackness of the moor  for some minutes he stood       watching intently  then he gave a deep groan and with an       impatient gesture he put out the light  instantly i made my way       back to my room  and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing       once more upon their return journey  long afterwards when i had       fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock        but i could not tell whence the sound came  what it all means i       cannot guess  but there is some secret business going on in this       house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom       of  i do not trouble you with my theories  for you asked me to       furnish you only with facts  i have had a long talk with sir       henry this morning  and we have made a plan of campaign founded       upon my observations of last night  i will not speak about it       just now  but it should make my next report interesting reading     chapter     the light upon the moor  second report of dr  watson         baskerville hall  oct    th         my dear holmes         if i was compelled to leave you without much news during the       early days of my mission you must acknowledge that i am making up       for lost time  and that events are now crowding thick and fast       upon us  in my last report i ended upon my top note with       barrymore at the window  and now i have quite a budget already       which will  unless i am much mistaken  considerably surprise you        things have taken a turn which i could not have anticipated  in       some ways they have within the last forty eight hours become much       clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated  but i       will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself         before breakfast on the morning following my adventure i went       down the corridor and examined the room in which barrymore had       been on the night before  the western window through which he had       stared so intently has  i noticed  one peculiarity above all       other windows in the house it commands the nearest outlook on to       the moor  there is an opening between two trees which enables one       from this point of view to look right down upon it  while from       all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be       obtained  it follows  therefore  that barrymore  since only this       window would serve the purpose  must have been looking out for       something or somebody upon the moor  the night was very dark  so       that i can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone        it had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was       on foot  that would have accounted for his stealthy movements and       also for the uneasiness of his wife  the man is a       striking looking fellow  very well equipped to steal the heart of       a country girl  so that this theory seemed to have something to       support it  that opening of the door which i had heard after i       had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep       some clandestine appointment  so i reasoned with myself in the       morning  and i tell you the direction of my suspicions  however       much the result may have shown that they were unfounded         but whatever the true explanation of barrymore s movements might       be  i felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself       until i could explain them was more than i could bear  i had an       interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast  and i       told him all that i had seen  he was less surprised than i had       expected          i knew that barrymore walked about nights  and i had a mind to       speak to him about it   said he   two or three times i have heard       his steps in the passage  coming and going  just about the hour       you name           perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular       window   i suggested          perhaps he does  if so  we should be able to shadow him and see       what it is that he is after  i wonder what your friend holmes       would do if he were here           i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest   said       i   he would follow barrymore and see what he did           then we shall do it together           but surely he would hear us           the man is rather deaf  and in any case we must take our chance       of that  we ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he       passes   sir henry rubbed his hands with pleasure  and it was       evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat       quiet life upon the moor         the baronet has been in communication with the architect who       prepared the plans for sir charles  and with a contractor from       london  so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon        there have been decorators and furnishers up from plymouth  and       it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare       no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family  when       the house is renovated and refurnished  all that he will need       will be a wife to make it complete  between ourselves there are       pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is       willing  for i have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a       woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour  miss stapleton        and yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as       one would under the circumstances expect  today  for example  its       surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple  which has caused       our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance         after the conversation which i have quoted about barrymore  sir       henry put on his hat and prepared to go out  as a matter of       course i did the same          what  are  you  coming  watson   he asked  looking at me in a       curious way          that depends on whether you are going on the moor   said i          yes  i am           well  you know what my instructions are  i am sorry to intrude        but you heard how earnestly holmes insisted that i should not       leave you  and especially that you should not go alone upon the       moor          sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile          my dear fellow   said he   holmes  with all his wisdom  did not       foresee some things which have happened since i have been on the       moor  you understand me  i am sure that you are the last man in       the world who would wish to be a spoil sport  i must go out       alone          it put me in a most awkward position  i was at a loss what to say       or what to do  and before i had made up my mind he picked up his       cane and was gone         but when i came to think the matter over my conscience reproached       me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my       sight  i imagined what my feelings would be if i had to return to       you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my       disregard for your instructions  i assure you my cheeks flushed       at the very thought  it might not even now be too late to       overtake him  so i set off at once in the direction of merripit       house         i hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing       anything of sir henry  until i came to the point where the moor       path branches off  there  fearing that perhaps i had come in the       wrong direction after all  i mounted a hill from which i could       command a view the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry        thence i saw him at once  he was on the moor path about a quarter       of a mile off  and a lady was by his side who could only be miss       stapleton  it was clear that there was already an understanding       between them and that they had met by appointment  they were       walking slowly along in deep conversation  and i saw her making       quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest       in what she was saying  while he listened intently  and once or       twice shook his head in strong dissent  i stood among the rocks       watching them  very much puzzled as to what i should do next  to       follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to       be an outrage  and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to       let him out of my sight  to act the spy upon a friend was a       hateful task  still  i could see no better course than to observe       him from the hill  and to clear my conscience by confessing to       him afterwards what i had done  it is true that if any sudden       danger had threatened him i was too far away to be of use  and       yet i am sure that you will agree with me that the position was       very difficult  and that there was nothing more which i could do         our friend  sir henry  and the lady had halted on the path and       were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation  when i was       suddenly aware that i was not the only witness of their       interview  a wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye  and       another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man       who was moving among the broken ground  it was stapleton with his       butterfly net  he was very much closer to the pair than i was        and he appeared to be moving in their direction  at this instant       sir henry suddenly drew miss stapleton to his side  his arm was       round her  but it seemed to me that she was straining away from       him with her face averted  he stooped his head to hers  and she       raised one hand as if in protest  next moment i saw them spring       apart and turn hurriedly round  stapleton was the cause of the       interruption  he was running wildly towards them  his absurd net       dangling behind him  he gesticulated and almost danced with       excitement in front of the lovers  what the scene meant i could       not imagine  but it seemed to me that stapleton was abusing sir       henry  who offered explanations  which became more angry as the       other refused to accept them  the lady stood by in haughty       silence  finally stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a       peremptory way to his sister  who  after an irresolute glance at       sir henry  walked off by the side of her brother  the       naturalist s angry gestures showed that the lady was included in       his displeasure  the baronet stood for a minute looking after       them  and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come        his head hanging  the very picture of dejection         what all this meant i could not imagine  but i was deeply ashamed       to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend s       knowledge  i ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at       the bottom  his face was flushed with anger and his brows were       wrinkled  like one who is at his wit s ends what to do          halloa  watson  where have you dropped from   said he   you       don t mean to say that you came after me in spite of all          i explained everything to him  how i had found it impossible to       remain behind  how i had followed him  and how i had witnessed       all that had occurred  for an instant his eyes blazed at me  but       my frankness disarmed his anger  and he broke at last into a       rather rueful laugh          you would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe       place for a man to be private   said he   but  by thunder  the       whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my       wooing and a mighty poor wooing at that  where had you engaged a       seat           i was on that hill           quite in the back row  eh  but her brother was well up to the       front  did you see him come out on us           yes  i did           did he ever strike you as being crazy this brother of hers           i can t say that he ever did           i dare say not  i always thought him sane enough until today        but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a       straitjacket  what s the matter with me  anyhow  you ve lived       near me for some weeks  watson  tell me straight  now  is there       anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a       woman that i loved           i should say not           he can t object to my worldly position  so it must be myself       that he has this down on  what has he against me  i never hurt       man or woman in my life that i know of  and yet he would not so       much as let me touch the tips of her fingers           did he say so           that  and a deal more  i tell you  watson  i ve only known her       these few weeks  but from the first i just felt that she was made       for me  and she  too she was happy when she was with me  and that       i ll swear  there s a light in a woman s eyes that speaks louder       than words  but he has never let us get together and it was only       today for the first time that i saw a chance of having a few       words with her alone  she was glad to meet me  but when she did       it was not love that she would talk about  and she wouldn t have       let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it  she       kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger  and that       she would never be happy until i had left it  i told her that       since i had seen her i was in no hurry to leave it  and that if       she really wanted me to go  the only way to work it was for her       to arrange to go with me  with that i offered in as many words to       marry her  but before she could answer  down came this brother of       hers  running at us with a face on him like a madman  he was just       white with rage  and those light eyes of his were blazing with       fury  what was i doing with the lady  how dared i offer her       attentions which were distasteful to her  did i think that       because i was a baronet i could do what i liked  if he had not       been her brother i should have known better how to answer him  as       it was i told him that my feelings towards his sister were such       as i was not ashamed of  and that i hoped that she might honour       me by becoming my wife  that seemed to make the matter no better        so then i lost my temper too  and i answered him rather more       hotly than i should perhaps  considering that she was standing       by  so it ended by his going off with her  as you saw  and here       am i as badly puzzled a man as any in this county  just tell me       what it all means  watson  and i ll owe you more than ever i can       hope to pay          i tried one or two explanations  but  indeed  i was completely       puzzled myself  our friend s title  his fortune  his age  his       character  and his appearance are all in his favour  and i know       nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his       family  that his advances should be rejected so brusquely without       any reference to the lady s own wishes and that the lady should       accept the situation without protest is very amazing  however        our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from stapleton       himself that very afternoon  he had come to offer apologies for       his rudeness of the morning  and after a long private interview       with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was       that the breach is quite healed  and that we are to dine at       merripit house next friday as a sign of it          i don t say now that he isn t a crazy man   said sir henry   i       can t forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning        but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology       than he has done           did he give any explanation of his conduct           his sister is everything in his life  he says  that is natural       enough  and i am glad that he should understand her value  they       have always been together  and according to his account he has       been a very lonely man with only her as a companion  so that the       thought of losing her was really terrible to him  he had not       understood  he said  that i was becoming attached to her  but       when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so  and that she       might be taken away from him  it gave him such a shock that for a       time he was not responsible for what he said or did  he was very       sorry for all that had passed  and he recognized how foolish and       how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a       beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life  if       she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like       myself than to anyone else  but in any case it was a blow to him       and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself       to meet it  he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i       would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be       content with cultivating the lady s friendship during that time       without claiming her love  this i promised  and so the matter       rests          so there is one of our small mysteries cleared up  it is       something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we       are floundering  we know now why stapleton looked with disfavour       upon his sister s suitor even when that suitor was so eligible a       one as sir henry  and now i pass on to another thread which i       have extricated out of the tangled skein  the mystery of the sobs       in the night  of the tear stained face of mrs  barrymore  of the       secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window        congratulate me  my dear holmes  and tell me that i have not       disappointed you as an agent that you do not regret the       confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down  all       these things have by one night s work been thoroughly cleared         i have said  by one night s work   but  in truth  it was by two       nights  work  for on the first we drew entirely blank  i sat up       with sir henry in his rooms until nearly three o clock in the       morning  but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming       clock upon the stairs  it was a most melancholy vigil and ended       by each of us falling asleep in our chairs  fortunately we were       not discouraged  and we determined to try again  the next night       we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the       least sound  it was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by        and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient       interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into       which he hopes the game may wander  one struck  and two  and we       had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an       instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary       senses keenly on the alert once more  we had heard the creak of a       step in the passage         very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the       distance  then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out       in pursuit  already our man had gone round the gallery and the       corridor was all in darkness  softly we stole along until we had       come into the other wing  we were just in time to catch a glimpse       of the tall  black bearded figure  his shoulders rounded as he       tiptoed down the passage  then he passed through the same door as       before  and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and       shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor  we       shuffled cautiously towards it  trying every plank before we       dared to put our whole weight upon it  we had taken the       precaution of leaving our boots behind us  but  even so  the old       boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread  sometimes it seemed       impossible that he should fail to hear our approach  however  the       man is fortunately rather deaf  and he was entirely preoccupied       in that which he was doing  when at last we reached the door and       peeped through we found him crouching at the window  candle in       hand  his white  intent face pressed against the pane  exactly as       i had seen him two nights before         we had arranged no plan of campaign  but the baronet is a man to       whom the most direct way is always the most natural  he walked       into the room  and as he did so barrymore sprang up from the       window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood  livid and       trembling  before us  his dark eyes  glaring out of the white       mask of his face  were full of horror and astonishment as he       gazed from sir henry to me          what are you doing here  barrymore           nothing  sir   his agitation was so great that he could hardly       speak  and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his       candle   it was the window  sir  i go round at night to see that       they are fastened           on the second floor           yes  sir  all the windows           look here  barrymore   said sir henry sternly   we have made up       our minds to have the truth out of you  so it will save you       trouble to tell it sooner rather than later  come  now  no lies        what were you doing at that window          the fellow looked at us in a helpless way  and he wrung his hands       together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and       misery          i was doing no harm  sir  i was holding a candle to the window           and why were you holding a candle to the window           don t ask me  sir henry don t ask me  i give you my word  sir        that it is not my secret  and that i cannot tell it  if it       concerned no one but myself i would not try to keep it from you          a sudden idea occurred to me  and i took the candle from the       trembling hand of the butler          he must have been holding it as a signal   said i   let us see       if there is any answer   i held it as he had done  and stared out       into the darkness of the night  vaguely i could discern the black       bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor  for the       moon was behind the clouds  and then i gave a cry of exultation        for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the       dark veil  and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square       framed by the window          there it is   i cried          no  no  sir  it is nothing nothing at all   the butler broke in         i assure you  sir           move your light across the window  watson   cried the baronet         see  the other moves also  now  you rascal  do you deny that it       is a signal  come  speak up  who is your confederate out yonder        and what is this conspiracy that is going on          the man s face became openly defiant   it is my business  and not       yours  i will not tell           then you leave my employment right away           very good  sir  if i must i must           and you go in disgrace  by thunder  you may well be ashamed of       yourself  your family has lived with mine for over a hundred       years under this roof  and here i find you deep in some dark plot       against me           no  no  sir  no  not against you   it was a woman s voice  and       mrs  barrymore  paler and more horror struck than her husband        was standing at the door  her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt       might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling       upon her face          we have to go  eliza  this is the end of it  you can pack our       things   said the butler          oh  john  john  have i brought you to this  it is my doing  sir       henry all mine  he has done nothing except for my sake and       because i asked him           speak out  then  what does it mean           my unhappy brother is starving on the moor  we cannot let him       perish at our very gates  the light is a signal to him that food       is ready for him  and his light out yonder is to show the spot to       which to bring it           then your brother is           the escaped convict  sir selden  the criminal           that s the truth  sir   said barrymore   i said that it was not       my secret and that i could not tell it to you  but now you have       heard it  and you will see that if there was a plot it was not       against you          this  then  was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at       night and the light at the window  sir henry and i both stared at       the woman in amazement  was it possible that this stolidly       respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most       notorious criminals in the country          yes  sir  my name was selden  and he is my younger brother  we       humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way       in everything until he came to think that the world was made for       his pleasure  and that he could do what he liked in it  then as       he grew older he met wicked companions  and the devil entered       into him until he broke my mother s heart and dragged our name in       the dirt  from crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is       only the mercy of god which has snatched him from the scaffold        but to me  sir  he was always the little curly headed boy that i       had nursed and played with as an elder sister would  that was why       he broke prison  sir  he knew that i was here and that we could       not refuse to help him  when he dragged himself here one night        weary and starving  with the warders hard at his heels  what       could we do  we took him in and fed him and cared for him  then       you returned  sir  and my brother thought he would be safer on       the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over  so he       lay in hiding there  but every second night we made sure if he       was still there by putting a light in the window  and if there       was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him        every day we hoped that he was gone  but as long as he was there       we could not desert him  that is the whole truth  as i am an       honest christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in       the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me  for whose       sake he has done all that he has          the woman s words came with an intense earnestness which carried       conviction with them          is this true  barrymore           yes  sir henry  every word of it           well  i cannot blame you for standing by your own wife  forget       what i have said  go to your room  you two  and we shall talk       further about this matter in the morning          when they were gone we looked out of the window again  sir henry       had flung it open  and the cold night wind beat in upon our       faces  far away in the black distance there still glowed that one       tiny point of yellow light          i wonder he dares   said sir henry          it may be so placed as to be only visible from here           very likely  how far do you think it is           out by the cleft tor  i think           not more than a mile or two off           hardly that           well  it cannot be far if barrymore had to carry out the food to       it  and he is waiting  this villain  beside that candle  by       thunder  watson  i am going out to take that man          the same thought had crossed my own mind  it was not as if the       barrymores had taken us into their confidence  their secret had       been forced from them  the man was a danger to the community  an       unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse        we were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him       back where he could do no harm  with his brutal and violent       nature  others would have to pay the price if we held our hands        any night  for example  our neighbours the stapletons might be       attacked by him  and it may have been the thought of this which       made sir henry so keen upon the adventure          i will come   said i          then get your revolver and put on your boots  the sooner we       start the better  as the fellow may put out his light and be       off          in five minutes we were outside the door  starting upon our       expedition  we hurried through the dark shrubbery  amid the dull       moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves        the night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay  now and       again the moon peeped out for an instant  but clouds were driving       over the face of the sky  and just as we came out on the moor a       thin rain began to fall  the light still burned steadily in       front          are you armed   i asked          i have a hunting crop           we must close in on him rapidly  for he is said to be a       desperate fellow  we shall take him by surprise and have him at       our mercy before he can resist           i say  watson   said the baronet   what would holmes say to       this  how about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil       is exalted          as if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast       gloom of the moor that strange cry which i had already heard upon       the borders of the great grimpen mire  it came with the wind       through the silence of the night  a long  deep mutter  then a       rising howl  and then the sad moan in which it died away  again       and again it sounded  the whole air throbbing with it  strident        wild  and menacing  the baronet caught my sleeve and his face       glimmered white through the darkness          my god  what s that  watson           i don t know  it s a sound they have on the moor  i heard it       once before          it died away  and an absolute silence closed in upon us  we stood       straining our ears  but nothing came          watson   said the baronet   it was the cry of a hound          my blood ran cold in my veins  for there was a break in his voice       which told of the sudden horror which had seized him          what do they call this sound   he asked          who           the folk on the countryside           oh  they are ignorant people  why should you mind what they call       it           tell me  watson  what do they say of it          i hesitated but could not escape the question          they say it is the cry of the hound of the baskervilles          he groaned and was silent for a few moments          a hound it was   he said at last   but it seemed to come from       miles away  over yonder  i think           it was hard to say whence it came           it rose and fell with the wind  isn t that the direction of the       great grimpen mire           yes  it is           well  it was up there  come now  watson  didn t you think       yourself that it was the cry of a hound  i am not a child  you       need not fear to speak the truth           stapleton was with me when i heard it last  he said that it       might be the calling of a strange bird           no  no  it was a hound  my god  can there be some truth in all       these stories  is it possible that i am really in danger from so       dark a cause  you don t believe it  do you  watson           no  no           and yet it was one thing to laugh about it in london  and it is       another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear       such a cry as that  and my uncle  there was the footprint of the       hound beside him as he lay  it all fits together  i don t think       that i am a coward  watson  but that sound seemed to freeze my       very blood  feel my hand          it was as cold as a block of marble          you ll be all right tomorrow           i don t think i ll get that cry out of my head  what do you       advise that we do now           shall we turn back           no  by thunder  we have come out to get our man  and we will do       it  we after the convict  and a hell hound  as likely as not        after us  come on  we ll see it through if all the fiends of the       pit were loose upon the moor          we stumbled slowly along in the darkness  with the black loom of       the craggy hills around us  and the yellow speck of light burning       steadily in front  there is nothing so deceptive as the distance       of a light upon a pitch dark night  and sometimes the glimmer       seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might       have been within a few yards of us  but at last we could see       whence it came  and then we knew that we were indeed very close        a guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which       flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also       to prevent it from being visible  save in the direction of       baskerville hall  a boulder of granite concealed our approach        and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light  it       was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle       of the moor  with no sign of life near it just the one straight       yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it          what shall we do now   whispered sir henry          wait here  he must be near his light  let us see if we can get a       glimpse of him          the words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him  over       the rocks  in the crevice of which the candle burned  there was       thrust out an evil yellow face  a terrible animal face  all       seamed and scored with vile passions  foul with mire  with a       bristling beard  and hung with matted hair  it might well have       belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on       the hillsides  the light beneath him was reflected in his small        cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the       darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps       of the hunters         something had evidently aroused his suspicions  it may have been       that barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to       give  or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking       that all was not well  but i could read his fears upon his wicked       face  any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the       darkness  i sprang forward therefore  and sir henry did the same        at the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and       hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had       sheltered us  i caught one glimpse of his short  squat  strongly       built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run  at the       same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds        we rushed over the brow of the hill  and there was our man       running with great speed down the other side  springing over the       stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat  a lucky       long shot of my revolver might have crippled him  but i had       brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an       unarmed man who was running away         we were both swift runners and in fairly good training  but we       soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him  we saw him       for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck       moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant       hill  we ran and ran until we were completely blown  but the       space between us grew ever wider  finally we stopped and sat       panting on two rocks  while we watched him disappearing in the       distance         and it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and       unexpected thing  we had risen from our rocks and were turning to       go home  having abandoned the hopeless chase  the moon was low       upon the right  and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up       against the lower curve of its silver disc  there  outlined as       black as an ebony statue on that shining background  i saw the       figure of a man upon the tor  do not think that it was a       delusion  holmes  i assure you that i have never in my life seen       anything more clearly  as far as i could judge  the figure was       that of a tall  thin man  he stood with his legs a little       separated  his arms folded  his head bowed  as if he were       brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which       lay before him  he might have been the very spirit of that       terrible place  it was not the convict  this man was far from the       place where the latter had disappeared  besides  he was a much       taller man  with a cry of surprise i pointed him out to the       baronet  but in the instant during which i had turned to grasp       his arm the man was gone  there was the sharp pinnacle of granite       still cutting the lower edge of the moon  but its peak bore no       trace of that silent and motionless figure         i wished to go in that direction and to search the tor  but it       was some distance away  the baronet s nerves were still quivering       from that cry  which recalled the dark story of his family  and       he was not in the mood for fresh adventures  he had not seen this       lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his       strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me   a       warder  no doubt   said he   the moor has been thick with them       since this fellow escaped   well  perhaps his explanation may be       the right one  but i should like to have some further proof of       it  today we mean to communicate to the princetown people where       they should look for their missing man  but it is hard lines that       we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our       own prisoner  such are the adventures of last night  and you must       acknowledge  my dear holmes  that i have done you very well in       the matter of a report  much of what i tell you is no doubt quite       irrelevant  but still i feel that it is best that i should let       you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those       which will be of most service to you in helping you to your       conclusions  we are certainly making some progress  so far as the       barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions  and that       has cleared up the situation very much  but the moor with its       mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as       ever  perhaps in my next i may be able to throw some light upon       this also  best of all would it be if you could come down to us        in any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next       few days     chapter      extract from the diary of dr  watson        so far i have been able to quote from the reports which i have       forwarded during these early days to sherlock holmes  now        however  i have arrived at a point in my narrative where i am       compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my       recollections  aided by the diary which i kept at the time  a few       extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which       are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory  i proceed        then  from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the       convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor          october     th   a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain        the house is banked in with rolling clouds  which rise now and       then to show the dreary curves of the moor  with thin  silver       veins upon the sides of the hills  and the distant boulders       gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces  it is       melancholy outside and in  the baronet is in a black reaction       after the excitements of the night  i am conscious myself of a       weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger ever present       danger  which is the more terrible because i am unable to define       it         and have i not cause for such a feeling  consider the long       sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister       influence which is at work around us  there is the death of the       last occupant of the hall  fulfilling so exactly the conditions       of the family legend  and there are the repeated reports from       peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor        twice i have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the       distant baying of a hound  it is incredible  impossible  that it       should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature  a spectral       hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its       howling is surely not to be thought of  stapleton may fall in       with such a superstition  and mortimer also  but if i have one       quality upon earth it is common sense  and nothing will persuade       me to believe in such a thing  to do so would be to descend to       the level of these poor peasants  who are not content with a mere       fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell fire shooting       from his mouth and eyes  holmes would not listen to such fancies        and i am his agent  but facts are facts  and i have twice heard       this crying upon the moor  suppose that there were really some       huge hound loose upon it  that would go far to explain       everything  but where could such a hound lie concealed  where did       it get its food  where did it come from  how was it that no one       saw it by day  it must be confessed that the natural explanation       offers almost as many difficulties as the other  and always        apart from the hound  there is the fact of the human agency in       london  the man in the cab  and the letter which warned sir henry       against the moor  this at least was real  but it might have been       the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy  where       is that friend or enemy now  has he remained in london  or has he       followed us down here  could he could he be the stranger whom i       saw upon the tor         it is true that i have had only the one glance at him  and yet       there are some things to which i am ready to swear  he is no one       whom i have seen down here  and i have now met all the       neighbours  the figure was far taller than that of stapleton  far       thinner than that of frankland  barrymore it might possibly have       been  but we had left him behind us  and i am certain that he       could not have followed us  a stranger then is still dogging us        just as a stranger dogged us in london  we have never shaken him       off  if i could lay my hands upon that man  then at last we might       find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties  to this one       purpose i must now devote all my energies         my first impulse was to tell sir henry all my plans  my second       and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as       possible to anyone  he is silent and distrait  his nerves have       been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor  i will say       nothing to add to his anxieties  but i will take my own steps to       attain my own end         we had a small scene this morning after breakfast  barrymore       asked leave to speak with sir henry  and they were closeted in       his study some little time  sitting in the billiard room i more       than once heard the sound of voices raised  and i had a pretty       good idea what the point was which was under discussion  after a       time the baronet opened his door and called for me   barrymore       considers that he has a grievance   he said   he thinks that it       was unfair on our part to hunt his brother in law down when he        of his own free will  had told us the secret          the butler was standing very pale but very collected before us          i may have spoken too warmly  sir   said he   and if i have  i       am sure that i beg your pardon  at the same time  i was very much       surprised when i heard you two gentlemen come back this morning       and learned that you had been chasing selden  the poor fellow has       enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track           if you had told us of your own free will it would have been a       different thing   said the baronet   you only told us  or rather       your wife only told us  when it was forced from you and you could       not help yourself           i didn t think you would have taken advantage of it  sir       henry indeed i didn t           the man is a public danger  there are lonely houses scattered       over the moor  and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing  you       only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that  look at mr        stapleton s house  for example  with no one but himself to defend       it  there s no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key           he ll break into no house  sir  i give you my solemn word upon       that  but he will never trouble anyone in this country again  i       assure you  sir henry  that in a very few days the necessary       arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to       south america  for god s sake  sir  i beg of you not to let the       police know that he is still on the moor  they have given up the       chase there  and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for       him  you can t tell on him without getting my wife and me into       trouble  i beg you  sir  to say nothing to the police           what do you say  watson          i shrugged my shoulders   if he were safely out of the country it       would relieve the tax payer of a burden           but how about the chance of his holding someone up before he       goes           he would not do anything so mad  sir  we have provided him with       all that he can want  to commit a crime would be to show where he       was hiding           that is true   said sir henry   well  barrymore           god bless you  sir  and thank you from my heart  it would have       killed my poor wife had he been taken again           i guess we are aiding and abetting a felony  watson  but  after       what we have heard i don t feel as if i could give the man up  so       there is an end of it  all right  barrymore  you can go          with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned  but he       hesitated and then came back          you ve been so kind to us  sir  that i should like to do the       best i can for you in return  i know something  sir henry  and       perhaps i should have said it before  but it was long after the       inquest that i found it out  i ve never breathed a word about it       yet to mortal man  it s about poor sir charles s death          the baronet and i were both upon our feet   do you know how he       died           no  sir  i don t know that           what then           i know why he was at the gate at that hour  it was to meet a       woman           to meet a woman  he           yes  sir           and the woman s name           i can t give you the name  sir  but i can give you the initials        her initials were l  l           how do you know this  barrymore           well  sir henry  your uncle had a letter that morning  he had       usually a great many letters  for he was a public man and well       known for his kind heart  so that everyone who was in trouble was       glad to turn to him  but that morning  as it chanced  there was       only this one letter  so i took the more notice of it  it was       from coombe tracey  and it was addressed in a woman s hand           well           well  sir  i thought no more of the matter  and never would have       done had it not been for my wife  only a few weeks ago she was       cleaning out sir charles s study it had never been touched since       his death and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back       of the grate  the greater part of it was charred to pieces  but       one little slip  the end of a page  hung together  and the       writing could still be read  though it was grey on a black       ground  it seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the       letter and it said   please  please  as you are a gentleman  burn       this letter  and be at the gate by ten o clock  beneath it were       signed the initials l  l           have you got that slip           no  sir  it crumbled all to bits after we moved it           had sir charles received any other letters in the same writing           well  sir  i took no particular notice of his letters  i should       not have noticed this one  only it happened to come alone           and you have no idea who l  l  is           no  sir  no more than you have  but i expect if we could lay our       hands upon that lady we should know more about sir charles s       death           i cannot understand  barrymore  how you came to conceal this       important information           well  sir  it was immediately after that our own trouble came to       us  and then again  sir  we were both of us very fond of sir       charles  as we well might be considering all that he has done for       us  to rake this up couldn t help our poor master  and it s well       to go carefully when there s a lady in the case  even the best of       us           you thought it might injure his reputation           well  sir  i thought no good could come of it  but now you have       been kind to us  and i feel as if it would be treating you       unfairly not to tell you all that i know about the matter           very good  barrymore  you can go   when the butler had left us       sir henry turned to me   well  watson  what do you think of this       new light           it seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before           so i think  but if we can only trace l  l  it should clear up       the whole business  we have gained that much  we know that there       is someone who has the facts if we can only find her  what do you       think we should do           let holmes know all about it at once  it will give him the clue       for which he has been seeking  i am much mistaken if it does not       bring him down          i went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning s       conversation for holmes  it was evident to me that he had been       very busy of late  for the notes which i had from baker street       were few and short  with no comments upon the information which i       had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission  no doubt his       blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties  and yet this       new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his       interest  i wish that he were here          october     th   all day today the rain poured down  rustling on       the ivy and dripping from the eaves  i thought of the convict out       upon the bleak  cold  shelterless moor  poor devil  whatever his       crimes  he has suffered something to atone for them  and then i       thought of that other one the face in the cab  the figure against       the moon  was he also out in that deluged the unseen watcher  the       man of darkness  in the evening i put on my waterproof and i       walked far upon the sodden moor  full of dark imaginings  the       rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears        god help those who wander into the great mire now  for even the       firm uplands are becoming a morass  i found the black tor upon       which i had seen the solitary watcher  and from its craggy summit       i looked out myself across the melancholy downs  rain squalls       drifted across their russet face  and the heavy  slate coloured       clouds hung low over the landscape  trailing in grey wreaths down       the sides of the fantastic hills  in the distant hollow on the       left  half hidden by the mist  the two thin towers of baskerville       hall rose above the trees  they were the only signs of human life       which i could see  save only those prehistoric huts which lay       thickly upon the slopes of the hills  nowhere was there any trace       of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot two nights       before         as i walked back i was overtaken by dr  mortimer driving in his       dog cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying       farmhouse of foulmire  he has been very attentive to us  and       hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see       how we were getting on  he insisted upon my climbing into his       dog cart  and he gave me a lift homeward  i found him much       troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel  it had       wandered on to the moor and had never come back  i gave him such       consolation as i might  but i thought of the pony on the grimpen       mire  and i do not fancy that he will see his little dog again          by the way  mortimer   said i as we jolted along the rough road         i suppose there are few people living within driving distance of       this whom you do not know           hardly any  i think           can you  then  tell me the name of any woman whose initials are       l  l           he thought for a few minutes          no   said he   there are a few gipsies and labouring folk for       whom i can t answer  but among the farmers or gentry there is no       one whose initials are those  wait a bit though   he added after       a pause   there is laura lyons her initials are l  l  but she       lives in coombe tracey           who is she   i asked          she is frankland s daughter           what  old frankland the crank           exactly  she married an artist named lyons  who came sketching       on the moor  he proved to be a blackguard and deserted her  the       fault from what i hear may not have been entirely on one side        her father refused to have anything to do with her because she       had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other       reasons as well  so  between the old sinner and the young one the       girl has had a pretty bad time           how does she live           i fancy old frankland allows her a pittance  but it cannot be       more  for his own affairs are considerably involved  whatever she       may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the       bad  her story got about  and several of the people here did       something to enable her to earn an honest living  stapleton did       for one  and sir charles for another  i gave a trifle myself  it       was to set her up in a typewriting business          he wanted to know the object of my inquiries  but i managed to       satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much  for there is       no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence  tomorrow       morning i shall find my way to coombe tracey  and if i can see       this mrs  laura lyons  of equivocal reputation  a long step will       have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of       mysteries  i am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent        for when mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent       i asked him casually to what type frankland s skull belonged  and       so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive  i have       not lived for years with sherlock holmes for nothing         i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous       and melancholy day  this was my conversation with barrymore just       now  which gives me one more strong card which i can play in due       time         mortimer had stayed to dinner  and he and the baronet played        cart  afterwards  the butler brought me my coffee into the       library  and i took the chance to ask him a few questions          well   said i   has this precious relation of yours departed  or       is he still lurking out yonder           i don t know  sir  i hope to heaven that he has gone  for he has       brought nothing but trouble here  i ve not heard of him since i       left out food for him last  and that was three days ago           did you see him then           no  sir  but the food was gone when next i went that way           then he was certainly there           so you would think  sir  unless it was the other man who took       it          i sat with my coffee cup halfway to my lips and stared at       barrymore          you know that there is another man then           yes  sir  there is another man upon the moor           have you seen him           no  sir           how do you know of him then           selden told me of him  sir  a week ago or more  he s in hiding        too  but he s not a convict as far as i can make out  i don t       like it  dr  watson i tell you straight  sir  that i don t like       it   he spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness          now  listen to me  barrymore  i have no interest in this matter       but that of your master  i have come here with no object except       to help him  tell me  frankly  what it is that you don t like          barrymore hesitated for a moment  as if he regretted his outburst       or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words          it s all these goings on  sir   he cried at last  waving his       hand towards the rain lashed window which faced the moor         there s foul play somewhere  and there s black villainy brewing        to that i ll swear  very glad i should be  sir  to see sir henry       on his way back to london again           but what is it that alarms you           look at sir charles s death  that was bad enough  for all that       the coroner said  look at the noises on the moor at night        there s not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for       it  look at this stranger hiding out yonder  and watching and       waiting  what s he waiting for  what does it mean  it means no       good to anyone of the name of baskerville  and very glad i shall       be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henry s new servants       are ready to take over the hall           but about this stranger   said i   can you tell me anything       about him  what did selden say  did he find out where he hid  or       what he was doing           he saw him once or twice  but he is a deep one and gives nothing       away  at first he thought that he was the police  but soon he       found that he had some lay of his own  a kind of gentleman he       was  as far as he could see  but what he was doing he could not       make out           and where did he say that he lived           among the old houses on the hillside the stone huts where the       old folk used to live           but how about his food           selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and       brings all he needs  i dare say he goes to coombe tracey for what       he wants           very good  barrymore  we may talk further of this some other       time   when the butler had gone i walked over to the black       window  and i looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds       and at the tossing outline of the wind swept trees  it is a wild       night indoors  and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor        what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in       such a place at such a time  and what deep and earnest purpose       can he have which calls for such a trial  there  in that hut upon       the moor  seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has       vexed me so sorely  i swear that another day shall not have       passed before i have done all that man can do to reach the heart       of the mystery     chapter      the man on the tor        the extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter       has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of october  a time       when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their       terrible conclusion  the incidents of the next few days are       indelibly graven upon my recollection  and i can tell them       without reference to the notes made at the time  i start them       from the day which succeeded that upon which i had established       two facts of great importance  the one that mrs  laura lyons of       coombe tracey had written to sir charles baskerville and made an       appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his       death  the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be       found among the stone huts upon the hillside  with these two       facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my       courage must be deficient if i could not throw some further light       upon these dark places         i had no opportunity to tell the baronet what i had learned about       mrs  lyons upon the evening before  for dr  mortimer remained       with him at cards until it was very late  at breakfast  however        i informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would       care to accompany me to coombe tracey  at first he was very eager       to come  but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i       went alone the results might be better  the more formal we made       the visit the less information we might obtain  i left sir henry       behind  therefore  not without some prickings of conscience  and       drove off upon my new quest         when i reached coombe tracey i told perkins to put up the horses        and i made inquiries for the lady whom i had come to interrogate        i had no difficulty in finding her rooms  which were central and       well appointed  a maid showed me in without ceremony  and as i       entered the sitting room a lady  who was sitting before a       remington typewriter  sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome        her face fell  however  when she saw that i was a stranger  and       she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit         the first impression left by mrs  lyons was one of extreme       beauty  her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour  and       her cheeks  though considerably freckled  were flushed with the       exquisite bloom of the brunette  the dainty pink which lurks at       the heart of the sulphur rose  admiration was  i repeat  the       first impression  but the second was criticism  there was       something subtly wrong with the face  some coarseness of       expression  some hardness  perhaps  of eye  some looseness of lip       which marred its perfect beauty  but these  of course  are       afterthoughts  at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in       the presence of a very handsome woman  and that she was asking me       the reasons for my visit  i had not quite understood until that       instant how delicate my mission was          i have the pleasure   said i   of knowing your father          it was a clumsy introduction  and the lady made me feel it         there is nothing in common between my father and me   she said         i owe him nothing  and his friends are not mine  if it were not       for the late sir charles baskerville and some other kind hearts i       might have starved for all that my father cared           it was about the late sir charles baskerville that i have come       here to see you          the freckles started out on the lady s face          what can i tell you about him   she asked  and her fingers       played nervously over the stops of her typewriter          you knew him  did you not           i have already said that i owe a great deal to his kindness  if       i am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest       which he took in my unhappy situation           did you correspond with him          the lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes          what is the object of these questions   she asked sharply          the object is to avoid a public scandal  it is better that i       should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our       control          she was silent and her face was still very pale  at last she       looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner          well  i ll answer   she said   what are your questions           did you correspond with sir charles           i certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his       delicacy and his generosity           have you the dates of those letters           no           have you ever met him           yes  once or twice  when he came into coombe tracey  he was a       very retiring man  and he preferred to do good by stealth           but if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom  how did he       know enough about your affairs to be able to help you  as you say       that he has done          she met my difficulty with the utmost readiness          there were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united       to help me  one was mr  stapleton  a neighbour and intimate       friend of sir charles s  he was exceedingly kind  and it was       through him that sir charles learned about my affairs          i knew already that sir charles baskerville had made stapleton       his almoner upon several occasions  so the lady s statement bore       the impress of truth upon it          did you ever write to sir charles asking him to meet you   i       continued         mrs  lyons flushed with anger again   really  sir  this is a very       extraordinary question           i am sorry  madam  but i must repeat it           then i answer  certainly not           not on the very day of sir charles s death          the flush had faded in an instant  and a deathly face was before       me  her dry lips could not speak the  no  which i saw rather than       heard          surely your memory deceives you   said i   i could even quote a       passage of your letter  it ran  please  please  as you are a       gentleman  burn this letter  and be at the gate by ten o clock           i thought that she had fainted  but she recovered herself by a       supreme effort          is there no such thing as a gentleman   she gasped          you do sir charles an injustice  he  did  burn the letter  but       sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned  you       acknowledge now that you wrote it           yes  i did write it   she cried  pouring out her soul in a       torrent of words   i did write it  why should i deny it  i have       no reason to be ashamed of it  i wished him to help me  i       believed that if i had an interview i could gain his help  so i       asked him to meet me           but why at such an hour           because i had only just learned that he was going to london next       day and might be away for months  there were reasons why i could       not get there earlier           but why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the       house           do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor s       house           well  what happened when you did get there           i never went           mrs  lyons           no  i swear it to you on all i hold sacred  i never went        something intervened to prevent my going           what was that           that is a private matter  i cannot tell it           you acknowledge then that you made an appointment with sir       charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death  but       you deny that you kept the appointment           that is the truth          again and again i cross questioned her  but i could never get       past that point          mrs  lyons   said i as i rose from this long and inconclusive       interview   you are taking a very great responsibility and       putting yourself in a very false position by not making an       absolutely clean breast of all that you know  if i have to call       in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are       compromised  if your position is innocent  why did you in the       first instance deny having written to sir charles upon that       date           because i feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from       it and that i might find myself involved in a scandal           and why were you so pressing that sir charles should destroy       your letter           if you have read the letter you will know           i did not say that i had read all the letter           you quoted some of it           i quoted the postscript  the letter had  as i said  been burned       and it was not all legible  i ask you once again why it was that       you were so pressing that sir charles should destroy this letter       which he received on the day of his death           the matter is a very private one           the more reason why you should avoid a public investigation           i will tell you  then  if you have heard anything of my unhappy       history you will know that i made a rash marriage and had reason       to regret it           i have heard so much           my life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom i       abhor  the law is upon his side  and every day i am faced by the       possibility that he may force me to live with him  at the time       that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there       was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses       could be met  it meant everything to me peace of mind  happiness        self respect everything  i knew sir charles s generosity  and i       thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help       me           then how is it that you did not go           because i received help in the interval from another source           why then  did you not write to sir charles and explain this           so i should have done had i not seen his death in the paper next       morning          the woman s story hung coherently together  and all my questions       were unable to shake it  i could only check it by finding if she       had  indeed  instituted divorce proceedings against her husband       at or about the time of the tragedy         it was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been       to baskerville hall if she really had been  for a trap would be       necessary to take her there  and could not have returned to       coombe tracey until the early hours of the morning  such an       excursion could not be kept secret  the probability was        therefore  that she was telling the truth  or  at least  a part       of the truth  i came away baffled and disheartened  once again i       had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every       path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission  and yet       the more i thought of the lady s face and of her manner the more       i felt that something was being held back from me  why should she       turn so pale  why should she fight against every admission until       it was forced from her  why should she have been so reticent at       the time of the tragedy  surely the explanation of all this could       not be as innocent as she would have me believe  for the moment i       could proceed no farther in that direction  but must turn back to       that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts       upon the moor         and that was a most vague direction  i realised it as i drove       back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient       people  barrymore s only indication had been that the stranger       lived in one of these abandoned huts  and many hundreds of them       are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor  but       i had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man       himself standing upon the summit of the black tor  that  then        should be the centre of my search  from there i should explore       every hut upon the moor until i lighted upon the right one  if       this man were inside it i should find out from his own lips  at       the point of my revolver if necessary  who he was and why he had       dogged us so long  he might slip away from us in the crowd of       regent street  but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely       moor  on the other hand  if i should find the hut and its tenant       should not be within it i must remain there  however long the       vigil  until he returned  holmes had missed him in london  it       would indeed be a triumph for me if i could run him to earth       where my master had failed         luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry  but now       at last it came to my aid  and the messenger of good fortune was       none other than mr  frankland  who was standing  grey whiskered       and red faced  outside the gate of his garden  which opened on to       the highroad along which i travelled          good day  dr  watson   cried he with unwonted good humour   you       must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass       of wine and to congratulate me          my feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after       what i had heard of his treatment of his daughter  but i was       anxious to send perkins and the wagonette home  and the       opportunity was a good one  i alighted and sent a message to sir       henry that i should walk over in time for dinner  then i followed       frankland into his dining room          it is a great day for me  sir one of the red letter days of my       life   he cried with many chuckles   i have brought off a double       event  i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law  and       that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it  i have       established a right of way through the centre of old middleton s       park  slap across it  sir  within a hundred yards of his own       front door  what do you think of that  we ll teach these magnates       that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners        confound them  and i ve closed the wood where the fernworthy folk       used to picnic  these infernal people seem to think that there       are no rights of property  and that they can swarm where they       like with their papers and their bottles  both cases decided  dr        watson  and both in my favour  i haven t had such a day since i       had sir john morland for trespass because he shot in his own       warren           how on earth did you do that           look it up in the books  sir  it will repay reading frankland        v   morland  court of queen s bench  it cost me       but i got       my verdict           did it do you any good           none  sir  none  i am proud to say that i had no interest in the       matter  i act entirely from a sense of public duty  i have no       doubt  for example  that the fernworthy people will burn me in       effigy tonight  i told the police last time they did it that they       should stop these disgraceful exhibitions  the county       constabulary is in a scandalous state  sir  and it has not       afforded me the protection to which i am entitled  the case of       frankland  v   regina will bring the matter before the attention       of the public  i told them that they would have occasion to       regret their treatment of me  and already my words have come       true           how so   i asked         the old man put on a very knowing expression   because i could       tell them what they are dying to know  but nothing would induce       me to help the rascals in any way          i had been casting round for some excuse by which i could get       away from his gossip  but now i began to wish to hear more of it        i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to       understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest       way to stop his confidences          some poaching case  no doubt   said i with an indifferent       manner          ha  ha  my boy  a very much more important matter than that        what about the convict on the moor          i stared   you don t mean that you know where he is   said i          i may not know exactly where he is  but i am quite sure that i       could help the police to lay their hands on him  has it never       struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where       he got his food and so trace it to him          he certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth         no doubt   said i   but how do you know that he is anywhere upon       the moor           i know it because i have seen with my own eyes the messenger who       takes him his food          my heart sank for barrymore  it was a serious thing to be in the       power of this spiteful old busybody  but his next remark took a       weight from my mind          you ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a       child  i see him every day through my telescope upon the roof  he       passes along the same path at the same hour  and to whom should       he be going except to the convict          here was luck indeed  and yet i suppressed all appearance of       interest  a child  barrymore had said that our unknown was       supplied by a boy  it was on his track  and not upon the       convict s  that frankland had stumbled  if i could get his       knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt  but incredulity       and indifference were evidently my strongest cards          i should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of       one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father s dinner          the least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old       autocrat  his eyes looked malignantly at me  and his grey       whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat          indeed  sir   said he  pointing out over the wide stretching       moor   do you see that black tor over yonder  well  do you see       the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it  it is the       stoniest part of the whole moor  is that a place where a shepherd       would be likely to take his station  your suggestion  sir  is a       most absurd one          i meekly answered that i had spoken without knowing all the       facts  my submission pleased him and led him to further       confidences          you may be sure  sir  that i have very good grounds before i       come to an opinion  i have seen the boy again and again with his       bundle  every day  and sometimes twice a day  i have been       able but wait a moment  dr  watson  do my eyes deceive me  or is       there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside          it was several miles off  but i could distinctly see a small dark       dot against the dull green and grey          come  sir  come   cried frankland  rushing upstairs   you will       see with your own eyes and judge for yourself          the telescope  a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod        stood upon the flat leads of the house  frankland clapped his eye       to it and gave a cry of satisfaction          quick  dr  watson  quick  before he passes over the hill          there he was  sure enough  a small urchin with a little bundle       upon his shoulder  toiling slowly up the hill  when he reached       the crest i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant       against the cold blue sky  he looked round him with a furtive and       stealthy air  as one who dreads pursuit  then he vanished over       the hill          well  am i right           certainly  there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand           and what the errand is even a county constable could guess  but       not one word shall they have from me  and i bind you to secrecy       also  dr  watson  not a word  you understand           just as you wish           they have treated me shamefully shamefully  when the facts come       out in frankland  v   regina i venture to think that a thrill of       indignation will run through the country  nothing would induce me       to help the police in any way  for all they cared it might have       been me  instead of my effigy  which these rascals burned at the       stake  surely you are not going  you will help me to empty the       decanter in honour of this great occasion          but i resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading       him from his announced intention of walking home with me  i kept       the road as long as his eye was on me  and then i struck off       across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy       had disappeared  everything was working in my favour  and i swore       that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that       i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way         the sun was already sinking when i reached the summit of the       hill  and the long slopes beneath me were all golden green on one       side and grey shadow on the other  a haze lay low upon the       farthest sky line  out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of       belliver and vixen tor  over the wide expanse there was no sound       and no movement  one great grey bird  a gull or curlew  soared       aloft in the blue heaven  he and i seemed to be the only living       things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath       it  the barren scene  the sense of loneliness  and the mystery       and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart  the boy       was nowhere to be seen  but down beneath me in a cleft of the       hills there was a circle of the old stone huts  and in the middle       of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a       screen against the weather  my heart leaped within me as i saw       it  this must be the burrow where the stranger lurked  at last my       foot was on the threshold of his hiding place his secret was       within my grasp         as i approached the hut  walking as warily as stapleton would do       when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly  i       satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a       habitation  a vague pathway among the boulders led to the       dilapidated opening which served as a door  all was silent       within  the unknown might be lurking there  or he might be       prowling on the moor  my nerves tingled with the sense of       adventure  throwing aside my cigarette  i closed my hand upon the       butt of my revolver and  walking swiftly up to the door  i looked       in  the place was empty         but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false       scent  this was certainly where the man lived  some blankets       rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which       neolithic man had once slumbered  the ashes of a fire were heaped       in a rude grate  beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket       half full of water  a litter of empty tins showed that the place       had been occupied for some time  and i saw  as my eyes became       accustomed to the checkered light  a pannikin and a half full       bottle of spirits standing in the corner  in the middle of the       hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table  and upon this       stood a small cloth bundle the same  no doubt  which i had seen       through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy  it contained       a loaf of bread  a tinned tongue  and two tins of preserved       peaches  as i set it down again  after having examined it  my       heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper       with writing upon it  i raised it  and this was what i read        roughly scrawled in pencil   dr  watson has gone to coombe       tracey          for a minute i stood there with the paper in my hands thinking       out the meaning of this curt message  it was i  then  and not sir       henry  who was being dogged by this secret man  he had not       followed me himself  but he had set an agent the boy        perhaps upon my track  and this was his report  possibly i had       taken no step since i had been upon the moor which had not been       observed and reported  always there was this feeling of an unseen       force  a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and       delicacy  holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme       moment that one realised that one was indeed entangled in its       meshes         if there was one report there might be others  so i looked round       the hut in search of them  there was no trace  however  of       anything of the kind  nor could i discover any sign which might       indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this       singular place  save that he must be of spartan habits and cared       little for the comforts of life  when i thought of the heavy       rains and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and       immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that       inhospitable abode  was he our malignant enemy  or was he by       chance our guardian angel  i swore that i would not leave the hut       until i knew         outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with       scarlet and gold  its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches       by the distant pools which lay amid the great grimpen mire  there       were the two towers of baskerville hall  and there a distant blur       of smoke which marked the village of grimpen  between the two        behind the hill  was the house of the stapletons  all was sweet       and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light  and yet as i       looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of nature but       quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which       every instant was bringing nearer  with tingling nerves but a       fixed purpose  i sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited       with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant         and then at last i heard him  far away came the sharp clink of a       boot striking upon a stone  then another and yet another  coming       nearer and nearer  i shrank back into the darkest corner and       cocked the pistol in my pocket  determined not to discover myself       until i had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger        there was a long pause which showed that he had stopped  then       once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the       opening of the hut          it is a lovely evening  my dear watson   said a well known       voice   i really think that you will be more comfortable outside       than in      chapter      death on the moor        for a moment or two i sat breathless  hardly able to believe my       ears  then my senses and my voice came back to me  while a       crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be       lifted from my soul  that cold  incisive  ironical voice could       belong to but one man in all the world          holmes   i cried  holmes           come out   said he   and please be careful with the revolver          i stooped under the rude lintel  and there he sat upon a stone       outside  his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon       my astonished features  he was thin and worn  but clear and       alert  his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the       wind  in his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other       tourist upon the moor  and he had contrived  with that catlike       love of personal cleanliness which was one of his       characteristics  that his chin should be as smooth and his linen       as perfect as if he were in baker street          i never was more glad to see anyone in my life   said i as i       wrung him by the hand          or more astonished  eh           well  i must confess to it           the surprise was not all on one side  i assure you  i had no       idea that you had found my occasional retreat  still less that       you were inside it  until i was within twenty paces of the door           my footprint  i presume           no  watson  i fear that i could not undertake to recognize your       footprint amid all the footprints of the world  if you seriously       desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist  for when i       see the stub of a cigarette marked bradley  oxford street  i know       that my friend watson is in the neighbourhood  you will see it       there beside the path  you threw it down  no doubt  at that       supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut           exactly           i thought as much and knowing your admirable tenacity i was       convinced that you were sitting in ambush  a weapon within reach        waiting for the tenant to return  so you actually thought that i       was the criminal           i did not know who you were  but i was determined to find out           excellent  watson  and how did you localise me  you saw me        perhaps  on the night of the convict hunt  when i was so       imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me           yes  i saw you then           and have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this       one           no  your boy had been observed  and that gave me a guide where       to look           the old gentleman with the telescope  no doubt  i could not make       it out when first i saw the light flashing upon the lens   he       rose and peeped into the hut   ha  i see that cartwright has       brought up some supplies  what s this paper  so you have been to       coombe tracey  have you           yes           to see mrs  laura lyons           exactly           well done  our researches have evidently been running on       parallel lines  and when we unite our results i expect we shall       have a fairly full knowledge of the case           well  i am glad from my heart that you are here  for indeed the       responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my       nerves  but how in the name of wonder did you come here  and what       have you been doing  i thought that you were in baker street       working out that case of blackmailing           that was what i wished you to think           then you use me  and yet do not trust me   i cried with some       bitterness   i think that i have deserved better at your hands        holmes           my dear fellow  you have been invaluable to me in this as in       many other cases  and i beg that you will forgive me if i have       seemed to play a trick upon you  in truth  it was partly for your       own sake that i did it  and it was my appreciation of the danger       which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter       for myself  had i been with sir henry and you it is confident       that my point of view would have been the same as yours  and my       presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on       their guard  as it is  i have been able to get about as i could       not possibly have done had i been living in the hall  and i       remain an unknown factor in the business  ready to throw in all       my weight at a critical moment           but why keep me in the dark           for you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have       led to my discovery  you would have wished to tell me something        or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or       other  and so an unnecessary risk would be run  i brought       cartwright down with me you remember the little chap at the       express office and he has seen after my simple wants  a loaf of       bread and a clean collar  what does man want more  he has given       me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet  and       both have been invaluable           then my reports have all been wasted   my voice trembled as i       recalled the pains and the pride with which i had composed them         holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket          here are your reports  my dear fellow  and very well thumbed  i       assure you  i made excellent arrangements  and they are only       delayed one day upon their way  i must compliment you exceedingly       upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an       extraordinarily difficult case          i was still rather raw over the deception which had been       practised upon me  but the warmth of holmes s praise drove my       anger from my mind  i felt also in my heart that he was right in       what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that i       should not have known that he was upon the moor          that s better   said he  seeing the shadow rise from my face         and now tell me the result of your visit to mrs  laura lyons it       was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you       had gone  for i am already aware that she is the one person in       coombe tracey who might be of service to us in the matter  in       fact  if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that i       should have gone tomorrow          the sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor  the air had       turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth  there        sitting together in the twilight  i told holmes of my       conversation with the lady  so interested was he that i had to       repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied          this is most important   said he when i had concluded   it fills       up a gap which i had been unable to bridge in this most complex       affair  you are aware  perhaps  that a close intimacy exists       between this lady and the man stapleton           i did not know of a close intimacy           there can be no doubt about the matter  they meet  they write        there is a complete understanding between them  now  this puts a       very powerful weapon into our hands  if i could only use it to       detach his wife           his wife           i am giving you some information now  in return for all that you       have given me  the lady who has passed here as miss stapleton is       in reality his wife           good heavens  holmes  are you sure of what you say  how could he       have permitted sir henry to fall in love with her           sir henry s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except       sir henry  he took particular care that sir henry did not make       love to her  as you have yourself observed  i repeat that the       lady is his wife and not his sister           but why this elaborate deception           because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to       him in the character of a free woman          all my unspoken instincts  my vague suspicions  suddenly took       shape and centred upon the naturalist  in that impassive       colourless man  with his straw hat and his butterfly net  i       seemed to see something terrible a creature of infinite patience       and craft  with a smiling face and a murderous heart          it is he  then  who is our enemy it is he who dogged us in       london           so i read the riddle           and the warning it must have come from her           exactly          the shape of some monstrous villainy  half seen  half guessed        loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long          but are you sure of this  holmes  how do you know that the woman       is his wife           because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of       autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you  and i dare       say he has many a time regretted it since  he was once a       schoolmaster in the north of england  now  there is no one more       easy to trace than a schoolmaster  there are scholastic agencies       by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession        a little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief       under atrocious circumstances  and that the man who had owned       it the name was different had disappeared with his wife  the       descriptions agreed  when i learned that the missing man was       devoted to entomology the identification was complete          the darkness was rising  but much was still hidden by the       shadows          if this woman is in truth his wife  where does mrs  laura lyons       come in   i asked          that is one of the points upon which your own researches have       shed a light  your interview with the lady has cleared the       situation very much  i did not know about a projected divorce       between herself and her husband  in that case  regarding       stapleton as an unmarried man  she counted no doubt upon becoming       his wife           and when she is undeceived           why  then we may find the lady of service  it must be our first       duty to see her both of us tomorrow  don t you think  watson        that you are away from your charge rather long  your place should       be at baskerville hall          the last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had       settled upon the moor  a few faint stars were gleaming in a       violet sky          one last question  holmes   i said as i rose   surely there is       no need of secrecy between you and me  what is the meaning of it       all  what is he after          holmes s voice sank as he answered          it is murder  watson refined  cold blooded  deliberate murder        do not ask me for particulars  my nets are closing upon him  even       as his are upon sir henry  and with your help he is already       almost at my mercy  there is but one danger which can threaten       us  it is that he should strike before we are ready to do so        another day two at the most and i have my case complete  but       until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother       watched her ailing child  your mission today has justified       itself  and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his       side  hark          a terrible scream a prolonged yell of horror and anguish burst       out of the silence of the moor  that frightful cry turned the       blood to ice in my veins          oh  my god   i gasped   what is it  what does it mean          holmes had sprung to his feet  and i saw his dark  athletic       outline at the door of the hut  his shoulders stooping  his head       thrust forward  his face peering into the darkness          hush   he whispered   hush          the cry had been loud on account of its vehemence  but it had       pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain  now it       burst upon our ears  nearer  louder  more urgent than before          where is it   holmes whispered  and i knew from the thrill of       his voice that he  the man of iron  was shaken to the soul         where is it  watson           there  i think   i pointed into the darkness          no  there          again the agonised cry swept through the silent night  louder and       much nearer than ever  and a new sound mingled with it  a deep        muttered rumble  musical and yet menacing  rising and falling       like the low  constant murmur of the sea          the hound   cried holmes   come  watson  come  great heavens  if       we are too late          he had started running swiftly over the moor  and i had followed       at his heels  but now from somewhere among the broken ground       immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell        and then a dull  heavy thud  we halted and listened  not another       sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night         i saw holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted        he stamped his feet upon the ground          he has beaten us  watson  we are too late           no  no  surely not           fool that i was to hold my hand  and you  watson  see what comes       of abandoning your charge  but  by heaven  if the worst has       happened we ll avenge him          blindly we ran through the gloom  blundering against boulders        forcing our way through gorse bushes  panting up hills and       rushing down slopes  heading always in the direction whence those       dreadful sounds had come  at every rise holmes looked eagerly       round him  but the shadows were thick upon the moor  and nothing       moved upon its dreary face          can you see anything           nothing           but  hark  what is that          a low moan had fallen upon our ears  there it was again upon our       left  on that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which       overlooked a stone strewn slope  on its jagged face was       spread eagled some dark  irregular object  as we ran towards it       the vague outline hardened into a definite shape  it was a       prostrate man face downward upon the ground  the head doubled       under him at a horrible angle  the shoulders rounded and the body       hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault  so       grotesque was the attitude that i could not for the instant       realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul  not a       whisper  not a rustle  rose now from the dark figure over which       we stooped  holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again       with an exclamation of horror  the gleam of the match which he       struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool       which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim  and it       shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint       within us the body of sir henry baskerville         there was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar       ruddy tweed suit the very one which he had worn on the first       morning that we had seen him in baker street  we caught the one       clear glimpse of it  and then the match flickered and went out        even as the hope had gone out of our souls  holmes groaned  and       his face glimmered white through the darkness          the brute  the brute   i cried with clenched hands   oh holmes        i shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate           i am more to blame than you  watson  in order to have my case       well rounded and complete  i have thrown away the life of my       client  it is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my       career  but how could i know how  could  i know that he would       risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my       warnings           that we should have heard his screams my god  those screams  and       yet have been unable to save him  where is this brute of a hound       which drove him to his death  it may be lurking among these rocks       at this instant  and stapleton  where is he  he shall answer for       this deed           he shall  i will see to that  uncle and nephew have been       murdered the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast       which he thought to be supernatural  the other driven to his end       in his wild flight to escape from it  but now we have to prove       the connection between the man and the beast  save from what we       heard  we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter  since       sir henry has evidently died from the fall  but  by heavens        cunning as he is  the fellow shall be in my power before another       day is past          we stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body        overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had       brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end  then       as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which       our poor friend had fallen  and from the summit we gazed out over       the shadowy moor  half silver and half gloom  far away  miles       off  in the direction of grimpen  a single steady yellow light       was shining  it could only come from the lonely abode of the       stapletons  with a bitter curse i shook my fist at it as i gazed          why should we not seize him at once           our case is not complete  the fellow is wary and cunning to the       last degree  it is not what we know  but what we can prove  if we       make one false move the villain may escape us yet           what can we do           there will be plenty for us to do tomorrow  tonight we can only       perform the last offices to our poor friend          together we made our way down the precipitous slope and       approached the body  black and clear against the silvered stones        the agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain       and blurred my eyes with tears          we must send for help  holmes  we cannot carry him all the way       to the hall  good heavens  are you mad          he had uttered a cry and bent over the body  now he was dancing       and laughing and wringing my hand  could this be my stern        self contained friend  these were hidden fires  indeed          a beard  a beard  the man has a beard           a beard           it is not the baronet it is why  it is my neighbour  the       convict          with feverish haste we had turned the body over  and that       dripping beard was pointing up to the cold  clear moon  there       could be no doubt about the beetling forehead  the sunken animal       eyes  it was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the       light of the candle from over the rock the face of selden  the       criminal         then in an instant it was all clear to me  i remembered how the       baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to       barrymore  barrymore had passed it on in order to help selden in       his escape  boots  shirt  cap it was all sir henry s  the tragedy       was still black enough  but this man had at least deserved death       by the laws of his country  i told holmes how the matter stood        my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy          then the clothes have been the poor devil s death   said he   it       is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article       of sir henry s the boot which was abstracted in the hotel  in all       probability and so ran this man down  there is one very singular       thing  however  how came selden  in the darkness  to know that       the hound was on his trail           he heard him           to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like       this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk       recapture by screaming wildly for help  by his cries he must have       run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track  how did       he know           a greater mystery to me is why this hound  presuming that all       our conjectures are correct           i presume nothing           well  then  why this hound should be loose tonight  i suppose       that it does not always run loose upon the moor  stapleton would       not let it go unless he had reason to think that sir henry would       be there           my difficulty is the more formidable of the two  for i think       that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours  while       mine may remain forever a mystery  the question now is  what       shall we do with this poor wretch s body  we cannot leave it here       to the foxes and the ravens           i suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can       communicate with the police           exactly  i have no doubt that you and i could carry it so far        halloa  watson  what s this  it s the man himself  by all that s       wonderful and audacious  not a word to show your suspicions not a       word  or my plans crumble to the ground          a figure was approaching us over the moor  and i saw the dull red       glow of a cigar  the moon shone upon him  and i could distinguish       the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist  he stopped       when he saw us  and then came on again          why  dr  watson  that s not you  is it  you are the last man       that i should have expected to see out on the moor at this time       of night  but  dear me  what s this  somebody hurt  not don t       tell me that it is our friend sir henry   he hurried past me and       stooped over the dead man  i heard a sharp intake of his breath       and the cigar fell from his fingers          who who s this   he stammered          it is selden  the man who escaped from princetown          stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us  but by a supreme effort       he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment  he looked       sharply from holmes to me   dear me  what a very shocking affair        how did he die           he appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks        my friend and i were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry           i heard a cry also  that was what brought me out  i was uneasy       about sir henry           why about sir henry in particular   i could not help asking          because i had suggested that he should come over  when he did       not come i was surprised  and i naturally became alarmed for his       safety when i heard cries upon the moor  by the way  his eyes       darted again from my face to holmes s  did you hear anything else       besides a cry           no   said holmes   did you           no           what do you mean  then           oh  you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom       hound  and so on  it is said to be heard at night upon the moor        i was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound       tonight           we heard nothing of the kind   said i          and what is your theory of this poor fellow s death           i have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off       his head  he has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and       eventually fallen over here and broken his neck           that seems the most reasonable theory   said stapleton  and he       gave a sigh which i took to indicate his relief   what do you       think about it  mr  sherlock holmes          my friend bowed his compliments   you are quick at       identification   said he          we have been expecting you in these parts since dr  watson came       down  you are in time to see a tragedy           yes  indeed  i have no doubt that my friend s explanation will       cover the facts  i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to       london with me tomorrow           oh  you return tomorrow           that is my intention           i hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences       which have puzzled us          holmes shrugged his shoulders          one cannot always have the success for which one hopes  an       investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours  it has not       been a satisfactory case          my friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner        stapleton still looked hard at him  then he turned to me          i would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house  but it       would give my sister such a fright that i do not feel justified       in doing it  i think that if we put something over his face he       will be safe until morning          and so it was arranged  resisting stapleton s offer of       hospitality  holmes and i set off to baskerville hall  leaving       the naturalist to return alone  looking back we saw the figure       moving slowly away over the broad moor  and behind him that one       black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was       lying who had come so horribly to his end          we re at close grips at last   said holmes as we walked together       across the moor   what a nerve the fellow has  how he pulled       himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing       shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his       plot  i told you in london  watson  and i tell you now again        that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel           i am sorry that he has seen you           and so was i at first  but there was no getting out of it           what effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he       knows you are here           it may cause him to be more cautious  or it may drive him to       desperate measures at once  like most clever criminals  he may be       too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has       completely deceived us           why should we not arrest him at once           my dear watson  you were born to be a man of action  your       instinct is always to do something energetic  but supposing  for       argument s sake  that we had him arrested tonight  what on earth       the better off should we be for that  we could prove nothing       against him  there s the devilish cunning of it  if he were       acting through a human agent we could get some evidence  but if       we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not       help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master           surely we have a case           not a shadow of one only surmise and conjecture  we should be       laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such       evidence           there is sir charles s death           found dead without a mark upon him  you and i know that he died       of sheer fright  and we know also what frightened him  but how       are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it  what signs are       there of a hound  where are the marks of its fangs  of course we       know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that sir charles       was dead before ever the brute overtook him  but we have to prove       all this  and we are not in a position to do it           well  then  tonight           we are not much better off tonight  again  there was no direct       connection between the hound and the man s death  we never saw       the hound  we heard it  but we could not prove that it was       running upon this man s trail  there is a complete absence of       motive  no  my dear fellow  we must reconcile ourselves to the       fact that we have no case at present  and that it is worth our       while to run any risk in order to establish one           and how do you propose to do so           i have great hopes of what mrs  laura lyons may do for us when       the position of affairs is made clear to her  and i have my own       plan as well  sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof  but i       hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last          i could draw nothing further from him  and he walked  lost in       thought  as far as the baskerville gates          are you coming up           yes  i see no reason for further concealment  but one last word        watson  say nothing of the hound to sir henry  let him think that       selden s death was as stapleton would have us believe  he will       have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo       tomorrow  when he is engaged  if i remember your report aright        to dine with these people           and so am i           then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone  that will be       easily arranged  and now  if we are too late for dinner  i think       that we are both ready for our suppers      chapter      fixing the nets        sir henry was more pleased than surprised to see sherlock holmes        for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would       bring him down from london  he did raise his eyebrows  however        when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any       explanations for its absence  between us we soon supplied his       wants  and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet       as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should       know  but first i had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to       barrymore and his wife  to him it may have been an unmitigated       relief  but she wept bitterly in her apron  to all the world he       was the man of violence  half animal and half demon  but to her       he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood  the       child who had clung to her hand  evil indeed is the man who has       not one woman to mourn him          i ve been moping in the house all day since watson went off in       the morning   said the baronet   i guess i should have some       credit  for i have kept my promise  if i hadn t sworn not to go       about alone i might have had a more lively evening  for i had a       message from stapleton asking me over there           i have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening         said holmes drily   by the way  i don t suppose you appreciate       that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck          sir henry opened his eyes   how was that           this poor wretch was dressed in your clothes  i fear your       servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the       police           that is unlikely  there was no mark on any of them  as far as i       know           that s lucky for him in fact  it s lucky for all of you  since       you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter  i am not       sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to       arrest the whole household  watson s reports are most       incriminating documents           but how about the case   asked the baronet   have you made       anything out of the tangle  i don t know that watson and i are       much the wiser since we came down           i think that i shall be in a position to make the situation       rather more clear to you before long  it has been an exceedingly       difficult and most complicated business  there are several points       upon which we still want light but it is coming all the same           we ve had one experience  as watson has no doubt told you  we       heard the hound on the moor  so i can swear that it is not all       empty superstition  i had something to do with dogs when i was       out west  and i know one when i hear one  if you can muzzle that       one and put him on a chain i ll be ready to swear you are the       greatest detective of all time           i think i will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will       give me your help           whatever you tell me to do i will do           very good  and i will ask you also to do it blindly  without       always asking the reason           just as you like           if you will do this i think the chances are that our little       problem will soon be solved  i have no doubt          he stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the       air  the lamp beat upon his face  and so intent was it and so       still that it might have been that of a clear cut classical       statue  a personification of alertness and expectation          what is it   we both cried         i could see as he looked down that he was repressing some       internal emotion  his features were still composed  but his eyes       shone with amused exultation          excuse the admiration of a connoisseur   said he as he waved his       hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite       wall   watson won t allow that i know anything of art but that is       mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ  now        these are a really very fine series of portraits           well  i m glad to hear you say so   said sir henry  glancing       with some surprise at my friend   i don t pretend to know much       about these things  and i d be a better judge of a horse or a       steer than of a picture  i didn t know that you found time for       such things           i know what is good when i see it  and i see it now  that s a       kneller  i ll swear  that lady in the blue silk over yonder  and       the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a reynolds  they are       all family portraits  i presume           every one           do you know the names           barrymore has been coaching me in them  and i think i can say my       lessons fairly well           who is the gentleman with the telescope           that is rear admiral baskerville  who served under rodney in the       west indies  the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is       sir william baskerville  who was chairman of committees of the       house of commons under pitt           and this cavalier opposite to me the one with the black velvet       and the lace           ah  you have a right to know about him  that is the cause of all       the mischief  the wicked hugo  who started the hound of the       baskervilles  we re not likely to forget him          i gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait          dear me   said holmes   he seems a quiet  meek mannered man       enough  but i dare say that there was a lurking devil in his       eyes  i had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person           there s no doubt about the authenticity  for the name and the       date        are on the back of the canvas          holmes said little more  but the picture of the old roysterer       seemed to have a fascination for him  and his eyes were       continually fixed upon it during supper  it was not until later        when sir henry had gone to his room  that i was able to follow       the trend of his thoughts  he led me back into the       banqueting hall  his bedroom candle in his hand  and he held it       up against the time stained portrait on the wall          do you see anything there          i looked at the broad plumed hat  the curling love locks  the       white lace collar  and the straight  severe face which was framed       between them  it was not a brutal countenance  but it was prim        hard  and stern  with a firm set  thin lipped mouth  and a coldly       intolerant eye          is it like anyone you know           there is something of sir henry about the jaw           just a suggestion  perhaps  but wait an instant   he stood upon       a chair  and  holding up the light in his left hand  he curved       his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets          good heavens   i cried in amazement         the face of stapleton had sprung out of the canvas          ha  you see it now  my eyes have been trained to examine faces       and not their trimmings  it is the first quality of a criminal       investigator that he should see through a disguise           but this is marvellous  it might be his portrait           yes  it is an interesting instance of a throwback  which appears       to be both physical and spiritual  a study of family portraits is       enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation  the       fellow is a baskerville that is evident           with designs upon the succession           exactly  this chance of the picture has supplied us with one of       our most obvious missing links  we have him  watson  we have him        and i dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering       in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies  a pin  a       cork  and a card  and we add him to the baker street collection         he burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away       from the picture  i have not heard him laugh often  and it has       always boded ill to somebody         i was up betimes in the morning  but holmes was afoot earlier       still  for i saw him as i dressed  coming up the drive          yes  we should have a full day today   he remarked  and he       rubbed his hands with the joy of action   the nets are all in       place  and the drag is about to begin  we ll know before the day       is out whether we have caught our big  lean jawed pike  or       whether he has got through the meshes           have you been on the moor already           i have sent a report from grimpen to princetown as to the death       of selden  i think i can promise that none of you will be       troubled in the matter  and i have also communicated with my       faithful cartwright  who would certainly have pined away at the       door of my hut  as a dog does at his master s grave  if i had not       set his mind at rest about my safety           what is the next move           to see sir henry  ah  here he is           good morning  holmes   said the baronet   you look like a       general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff           that is the exact situation  watson was asking for orders           and so do i           very good  you are engaged  as i understand  to dine with our       friends the stapletons tonight           i hope that you will come also  they are very hospitable people        and i am sure that they would be very glad to see you           i fear that watson and i must go to london           to london           yes  i think that we should be more useful there at the present       juncture          the baronet s face perceptibly lengthened          i hoped that you were going to see me through this business  the       hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is       alone           my dear fellow  you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what       i tell you  you can tell your friends that we should have been       happy to have come with you  but that urgent business required us       to be in town  we hope very soon to return to devonshire  will       you remember to give them that message           if you insist upon it           there is no alternative  i assure you          i saw by the baronet s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by       what he regarded as our desertion          when do you desire to go   he asked coldly          immediately after breakfast  we will drive in to coombe tracey        but watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come       back to you  watson  you will send a note to stapleton to tell       him that you regret that you cannot come           i have a good mind to go to london with you   said the baronet         why should i stay here alone           because it is your post of duty  because you gave me your word       that you would do as you were told  and i tell you to stay           all right  then  i ll stay           one more direction  i wish you to drive to merripit house  send       back your trap  however  and let them know that you intend to       walk home           to walk across the moor           yes           but that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me       not to do           this time you may do it with safety  if i had not every       confidence in your nerve and courage i would not suggest it  but       it is essential that you should do it           then i will do it           and as you value your life do not go across the moor in any       direction save along the straight path which leads from merripit       house to the grimpen road  and is your natural way home           i will do just what you say           very good  i should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast       as possible  so as to reach london in the afternoon          i was much astounded by this programme  though i remembered that       holmes had said to stapleton on the night before that his visit       would terminate next day  it had not crossed my mind however        that he would wish me to go with him  nor could i understand how       we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to       be critical  there was nothing for it  however  but implicit       obedience  so we bade good bye to our rueful friend  and a couple       of hours afterwards we were at the station of coombe tracey and       had dispatched the trap upon its return journey  a small boy was       waiting upon the platform          any orders  sir           you will take this train to town  cartwright  the moment you       arrive you will send a wire to sir henry baskerville  in my name        to say that if he finds the pocketbook which i have dropped he is       to send it by registered post to baker street           yes  sir           and ask at the station office if there is a message for me          the boy returned with a telegram  which holmes handed to me  it       ran         wire received  coming down with unsigned warrant  arrive       five forty  lestrade          that is in answer to mine of this morning  he is the best of the       professionals  i think  and we may need his assistance  now        watson  i think that we cannot employ our time better than by       calling upon your acquaintance  mrs  laura lyons          his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident  he would use       the baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were       really gone  while we should actually return at the instant when       we were likely to be needed  that telegram from london  if       mentioned by sir henry to the stapletons  must remove the last       suspicions from their minds  already i seemed to see our nets       drawing closer around that lean jawed pike         mrs  laura lyons was in her office  and sherlock holmes opened       his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably       amazed her          i am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of       the late sir charles baskerville   said he   my friend here  dr        watson  has informed me of what you have communicated  and also       of what you have withheld in connection with that matter           what have i withheld   she asked defiantly          you have confessed that you asked sir charles to be at the gate       at ten o clock  we know that that was the place and hour of his       death  you have withheld what the connection is between these       events           there is no connection           in that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary       one  but i think that we shall succeed in establishing a       connection  after all  i wish to be perfectly frank with you        mrs  lyons  we regard this case as one of murder  and the       evidence may implicate not only your friend mr  stapleton but his       wife as well          the lady sprang from her chair          his wife   she cried          the fact is no longer a secret  the person who has passed for       his sister is really his wife          mrs  lyons had resumed her seat  her hands were grasping the arms       of her chair  and i saw that the pink nails had turned white with       the pressure of her grip          his wife   she said again   his wife  he is not a married man          sherlock holmes shrugged his shoulders          prove it to me  prove it to me  and if you can do so           the fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words          i have come prepared to do so   said holmes  drawing several       papers from his pocket   here is a photograph of the couple taken       in york four years ago  it is indorsed  mr  and mrs  vandeleur         but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him  and her also        if you know her by sight  here are three written descriptions by       trustworthy witnesses of mr  and mrs  vandeleur  who at that time       kept st  oliver s private school  read them and see if you can       doubt the identity of these people          she glanced at them  and then looked up at us with the set  rigid       face of a desperate woman          mr  holmes   she said   this man had offered me marriage on       condition that i could get a divorce from my husband  he has lied       to me  the villain  in every conceivable way  not one word of       truth has he ever told me  and why why  i imagined that all was       for my own sake  but now i see that i was never anything but a       tool in his hands  why should i preserve faith with him who never       kept any with me  why should i try to shield him from the       consequences of his own wicked acts  ask me what you like  and       there is nothing which i shall hold back  one thing i swear to       you  and that is that when i wrote the letter i never dreamed of       any harm to the old gentleman  who had been my kindest friend           i entirely believe you  madam   said sherlock holmes   the       recital of these events must be very painful to you  and perhaps       it will make it easier if i tell you what occurred  and you can       check me if i make any material mistake  the sending of this       letter was suggested to you by stapleton           he dictated it           i presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive       help from sir charles for the legal expenses connected with your       divorce           exactly           and then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from       keeping the appointment           he told me that it would hurt his self respect that any other       man should find the money for such an object  and that though he       was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing       the obstacles which divided us           he appears to be a very consistent character  and then you heard       nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper           no           and he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with       sir charles           he did  he said that the death was a very mysterious one  and       that i should certainly be suspected if the facts came out  he       frightened me into remaining silent           quite so  but you had your suspicions          she hesitated and looked down          i knew him   she said   but if he had kept faith with me i       should always have done so with him           i think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape   said       sherlock holmes   you have had him in your power and he knew it        and yet you are alive  you have been walking for some months very       near to the edge of a precipice  we must wish you good morning       now  mrs  lyons  and it is probable that you will very shortly       hear from us again           our case becomes rounded off  and difficulty after difficulty       thins away in front of us   said holmes as we stood waiting for       the arrival of the express from town   i shall soon be in the       position of being able to put into a single connected narrative       one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times        students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in       godno  in little russia  in the year      and of course there are       the anderson murders in north carolina  but this case possesses       some features which are entirely its own  even now we have no       clear case against this very wily man  but i shall be very much       surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this       night          the london express came roaring into the station  and a small        wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first class carriage  we       all three shook hands  and i saw at once from the reverential way       in which lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a       good deal since the days when they had first worked together  i       could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner       used then to excite in the practical man          anything good   he asked          the biggest thing for years   said holmes   we have two hours       before we need think of starting  i think we might employ it in       getting some dinner and then  lestrade  we will take the london       fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night       air of dartmoor  never been there  ah  well  i don t suppose you       will forget your first visit      chapter      the hound of the baskervilles        one of sherlock holmes s defects if  indeed  one may call it a       defect was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full       plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment        partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature  which       loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him  partly       also from his professional caution  which urged him never to take       any chances  the result  however  was very trying for those who       were acting as his agents and assistants  i had often suffered       under it  but never more so than during that long drive in the       darkness  the great ordeal was in front of us  at last we were       about to make our final effort  and yet holmes had said nothing        and i could only surmise what his course of action would be  my       nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon       our faces and the dark  void spaces on either side of the narrow       road told me that we were back upon the moor once again  every       stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us       nearer to our supreme adventure         our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of       the hired wagonette  so that we were forced to talk of trivial       matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation        it was a relief to me  after that unnatural restraint  when we at       last passed frankland s house and knew that we were drawing near       to the hall and to the scene of action  we did not drive up to       the door but got down near the gate of the avenue  the wagonette       was paid off and ordered to return to coombe tracey forthwith        while we started to walk to merripit house          are you armed  lestrade          the little detective smiled   as long as i have my trousers i       have a hip pocket  and as long as i have my hip pocket i have       something in it           good  my friend and i are also ready for emergencies           you re mighty close about this affair  mr  holmes  what s the       game now           a waiting game           my word  it does not seem a very cheerful place   said the       detective with a shiver  glancing round him at the gloomy slopes       of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the       grimpen mire   i see the lights of a house ahead of us           that is merripit house and the end of our journey  i must       request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper          we moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the       house  but holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards       from it          this will do   said he   these rocks upon the right make an       admirable screen           we are to wait here           yes  we shall make our little ambush here  get into this hollow        lestrade  you have been inside the house  have you not  watson        can you tell the position of the rooms  what are those latticed       windows at this end           i think they are the kitchen windows           and the one beyond  which shines so brightly           that is certainly the dining room           the blinds are up  you know the lie of the land best  creep       forward quietly and see what they are doing but for heaven s sake       don t let them know that they are watched          i tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which       surrounded the stunted orchard  creeping in its shadow i reached       a point whence i could look straight through the uncurtained       window         there were only two men in the room  sir henry and stapleton        they sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the       round table  both of them were smoking cigars  and coffee and       wine were in front of them  stapleton was talking with animation        but the baronet looked pale and distrait  perhaps the thought of       that lonely walk across the ill omened moor was weighing heavily       upon his mind         as i watched them stapleton rose and left the room  while sir       henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair        puffing at his cigar  i heard the creak of a door and the crisp       sound of boots upon gravel  the steps passed along the path on       the other side of the wall under which i crouched  looking over        i saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out house in the       corner of the orchard  a key turned in a lock  and as he passed       in there was a curious scuffling noise from within  he was only a       minute or so inside  and then i heard the key turn once more and       he passed me and reentered the house  i saw him rejoin his guest        and i crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to       tell them what i had seen          you say  watson  that the lady is not there   holmes asked when       i had finished my report          no           where can she be  then  since there is no light in any other       room except the kitchen           i cannot think where she is          i have said that over the great grimpen mire there hung a dense        white fog  it was drifting slowly in our direction and banked       itself up like a wall on that side of us  low but thick and well       defined  the moon shone on it  and it looked like a great       shimmering ice field  with the heads of the distant tors as rocks       borne upon its surface  holmes s face was turned towards it  and       he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift          it s moving towards us  watson           is that serious           very serious  indeed the one thing upon earth which could have       disarranged my plans  he can t be very long  now  it is already       ten o clock  our success and even his life may depend upon his       coming out before the fog is over the path          the night was clear and fine above us  the stars shone cold and       bright  while a half moon bathed the whole scene in a soft        uncertain light  before us lay the dark bulk of the house  its       serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the       silver spangled sky  broad bars of golden light from the lower       windows stretched across the orchard and the moor  one of them       was suddenly shut off  the servants had left the kitchen  there       only remained the lamp in the dining room where the two men  the       murderous host and the unconscious guest  still chatted over       their cigars         every minute that white woolly plain which covered one half of       the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house  already the       first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of       the lighted window  the farther wall of the orchard was already       invisible  and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white       vapour  as we watched it the fog wreaths came crawling round both       corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on       which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship       upon a shadowy sea  holmes struck his hand passionately upon the       rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience          if he isn t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be       covered  in half an hour we won t be able to see our hands in       front of us           shall we move farther back upon higher ground           yes  i think it would be as well          so as the fog bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we       were half a mile from the house  and still that dense white sea        with the moon silvering its upper edge  swept slowly and       inexorably on          we are going too far   said holmes   we dare not take the chance       of his being overtaken before he can reach us  at all costs we       must hold our ground where we are   he dropped on his knees and       clapped his ear to the ground   thank god  i think that i hear       him coming          a sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor  crouching       among the stones we stared intently at the silver tipped bank in       front of us  the steps grew louder  and through the fog  as       through a curtain  there stepped the man whom we were awaiting        he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear        starlit night  then he came swiftly along the path  passed close       to where we lay  and went on up the long slope behind us  as he       walked he glanced continually over either shoulder  like a man       who is ill at ease          hist   cried holmes  and i heard the sharp click of a cocking       pistol   look out  it s coming          there was a thin  crisp  continuous patter from somewhere in the       heart of that crawling bank  the cloud was within fifty yards of       where we lay  and we glared at it  all three  uncertain what       horror was about to break from the heart of it  i was at holmes s       elbow  and i glanced for an instant at his face  it was pale and       exultant  his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight  but       suddenly they started forward in a rigid  fixed stare  and his       lips parted in amazement  at the same instant lestrade gave a       yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground  i       sprang to my feet  my inert hand grasping my pistol  my mind       paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from       the shadows of the fog  a hound it was  an enormous coal black       hound  but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen  fire       burst from its open mouth  its eyes glowed with a smouldering       glare  its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in       flickering flame  never in the delirious dream of a disordered       brain could anything more savage  more appalling  more hellish be       conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us       out of the wall of fog         with long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the       track  following hard upon the footsteps of our friend  so       paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass       before we had recovered our nerve  then holmes and i both fired       together  and the creature gave a hideous howl  which showed that       one at least had hit him  he did not pause  however  but bounded       onward  far away on the path we saw sir henry looking back  his       face white in the moonlight  his hands raised in horror  glaring       helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down  but       that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the       winds  if he was vulnerable he was mortal  and if we could wound       him we could kill him  never have i seen a man run as holmes ran       that night  i am reckoned fleet of foot  but he outpaced me as       much as i outpaced the little professional  in front of us as we       flew up the track we heard scream after scream from sir henry and       the deep roar of the hound  i was in time to see the beast spring       upon its victim  hurl him to the ground  and worry at his throat        but the next instant holmes had emptied five barrels of his       revolver into the creature s flank  with a last howl of agony and       a vicious snap in the air  it rolled upon its back  four feet       pawing furiously  and then fell limp upon its side  i stooped        panting  and pressed my pistol to the dreadful  shimmering head        but it was useless to press the trigger  the giant hound was       dead         sir henry lay insensible where he had fallen  we tore away his       collar  and holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw       that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in       time  already our friend s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble       effort to move  lestrade thrust his brandy flask between the       baronet s teeth  and two frightened eyes were looking up at us          my god   he whispered   what was it  what  in heaven s name  was       it           it s dead  whatever it is   said holmes   we ve laid the family       ghost once and forever          in mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was       lying stretched before us  it was not a pure bloodhound and it       was not a pure mastiff  but it appeared to be a combination of       the two gaunt  savage  and as large as a small lioness  even now       in the stillness of death  the huge jaws seemed to be dripping       with a bluish flame and the small  deep set  cruel eyes were       ringed with fire  i placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle  and       as i held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the       darkness          phosphorus   i said          a cunning preparation of it   said holmes  sniffing at the dead       animal   there is no smell which might have interfered with his       power of scent  we owe you a deep apology  sir henry  for having       exposed you to this fright  i was prepared for a hound  but not       for such a creature as this  and the fog gave us little time to       receive him           you have saved my life           having first endangered it  are you strong enough to stand           give me another mouthful of that brandy and i shall be ready for       anything  so  now  if you will help me up  what do you propose to       do           to leave you here  you are not fit for further adventures       tonight  if you will wait  one or other of us will go back with       you to the hall          he tried to stagger to his feet  but he was still ghastly pale       and trembling in every limb  we helped him to a rock  where he       sat shivering with his face buried in his hands          we must leave you now   said holmes   the rest of our work must       be done  and every moment is of importance  we have our case  and       now we only want our man          it s a thousand to one against our finding him at the house   he       continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path   those       shots must have told him that the game was up           we were some distance off  and this fog may have deadened them           he followed the hound to call him off of that you may be       certain  no  no  he s gone by this time  but we ll search the       house and make sure          the front door was open  so we rushed in and hurried from room to       room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant  who met us       in the passage  there was no light save in the dining room  but       holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house       unexplored  no sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing        on the upper floor  however  one of the bedroom doors was locked          there s someone in here   cried lestrade   i can hear a       movement  open this door          a faint moaning and rustling came from within  holmes struck the       door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew       open  pistol in hand  we all three rushed into the room         but there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant       villain whom we expected to see  instead we were faced by an       object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment       staring at it in amazement         the room had been fashioned into a small museum  and the walls       were lined by a number of glass topped cases full of that       collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had       been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man  in the       centre of this room there was an upright beam  which had been       placed at some period as a support for the old worm eaten baulk       of timber which spanned the roof  to this post a figure was tied        so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to       secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was       that of a man or a woman  one towel passed round the throat and       was secured at the back of the pillar  another covered the lower       part of the face  and over it two dark eyes eyes full of grief       and shame and a dreadful questioning stared back at us  in a       minute we had torn off the gag  unswathed the bonds  and mrs        stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us  as her beautiful       head fell upon her chest i saw the clear red weal of a whiplash       across her neck          the brute   cried holmes   here  lestrade  your brandy bottle        put her in the chair  she has fainted from ill usage and       exhaustion          she opened her eyes again          is he safe   she asked   has he escaped           he cannot escape us  madam           no  no  i did not mean my husband  sir henry  is he safe           yes           and the hound           it is dead          she gave a long sigh of satisfaction          thank god  thank god  oh  this villain  see how he has treated       me   she shot her arms out from her sleeves  and we saw with       horror that they were all mottled with bruises   but this is       nothing nothing  it is my mind and soul that he has tortured and       defiled  i could endure it all  ill usage  solitude  a life of       deception  everything  as long as i could still cling to the hope       that i had his love  but now i know that in this also i have been       his dupe and his tool   she broke into passionate sobbing as she       spoke          you bear him no good will  madam   said holmes   tell us then       where we shall find him  if you have ever aided him in evil  help       us now and so atone           there is but one place where he can have fled   she answered         there is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire        it was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made       preparations so that he might have a refuge  that is where he       would fly          the fog bank lay like white wool against the window  holmes held       the lamp towards it          see   said he   no one could find his way into the grimpen mire       tonight          she laughed and clapped her hands  her eyes and teeth gleamed       with fierce merriment          he may find his way in  but never out   she cried   how can he       see the guiding wands tonight  we planted them together  he and       i  to mark the pathway through the mire  oh  if i could only have       plucked them out today  then indeed you would have had him at       your mercy          it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog       had lifted  meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house       while holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville       hall  the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld       from him  but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth       about the woman whom he had loved  but the shock of the night s       adventures had shattered his nerves  and before morning he lay       delirious in a high fever under the care of dr  mortimer  the two       of them were destined to travel together round the world before       sir henry had become once more the hale  hearty man that he had       been before he became master of that ill omened estate         and now i come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular       narrative  in which i have tried to make the reader share those       dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and       ended in so tragic a manner  on the morning after the death of       the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by mrs  stapleton       to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog  it       helped us to realise the horror of this woman s life when we saw       the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband s       track  we left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm        peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog  from the       end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the       path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those       green scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the       stranger  rank reeds and lush  slimy water plants sent an odour       of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces  while a       false step plunged us more than once thigh deep into the dark        quivering mire  which shook for yards in soft undulations around       our feet  its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked        and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was       tugging us down into those obscene depths  so grim and purposeful       was the clutch in which it held us  once only we saw a trace that       someone had passed that perilous way before us  from amid a tuft       of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing       was projecting  holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the       path to seize it  and had we not been there to drag him out he       could never have set his foot upon firm land again  he held an       old black boot in the air   meyers  toronto   was printed on the       leather inside          it is worth a mud bath   said he   it is our friend sir henry s       missing boot           thrown there by stapleton in his flight           exactly  he retained it in his hand after using it to set the       hound upon the track  he fled when he knew the game was up  still       clutching it  and he hurled it away at this point of his flight        we know at least that he came so far in safety          but more than that we were never destined to know  though there       was much which we might surmise  there was no chance of finding       footsteps in the mire  for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon       them  but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass       we all looked eagerly for them  but no slightest sign of them       ever met our eyes  if the earth told a true story  then stapleton       never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled       through the fog upon that last night  somewhere in the heart of       the great grimpen mire  down in the foul slime of the huge morass       which had sucked him in  this cold and cruel hearted man is       forever buried         many traces we found of him in the bog girt island where he had       hid his savage ally  a huge driving wheel and a shaft half filled       with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine  beside it       were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners  driven       away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp  in one       of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones       showed where the animal had been confined  a skeleton with a       tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the  d bris           a dog   said holmes   by jove  a curly haired spaniel  poor       mortimer will never see his pet again  well  i do not know that       this place contains any secret which we have not already       fathomed  he could hide his hound  but he could not hush its       voice  and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not       pleasant to hear  on an emergency he could keep the hound in the       out house at merripit  but it was always a risk  and it was only       on the supreme day  which he regarded as the end of all his       efforts  that he dared do it  this paste in the tin is no doubt       the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed  it was       suggested  of course  by the story of the family hell hound  and       by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death  no wonder the       poor devil of a convict ran and screamed  even as our friend did        and as we ourselves might have done  when he saw such a creature       bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track  it was       a cunning device  for  apart from the chance of driving your       victim to his death  what peasant would venture to inquire too       closely into such a creature should he get sight of it  as many       have done  upon the moor  i said it in london  watson  and i say       it again now  that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more       dangerous man than he who is lying yonder  he swept his long arm       towards the huge mottled expanse of green splotched bog which       stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the       moor     chapter      a retrospection        it was the end of november  and holmes and i sat  upon a raw and       foggy night  on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting room       in baker street  since the tragic upshot of our visit to       devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost       importance  in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious       conduct of colonel upwood in connection with the famous card       scandal of the nonpareil club  while in the second he had       defended the unfortunate mme  montpensier from the charge of       murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her       step daughter  mlle  car re  the young lady who  as it will be       remembered  was found six months later alive and married in new       york  my friend was in excellent spirits over the success which       had attended a succession of difficult and important cases  so       that i was able to induce him to discuss the details of the       baskerville mystery  i had waited patiently for the opportunity       for i was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap  and       that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its       present work to dwell upon memories of the past  sir henry and       dr  mortimer were  however  in london  on their way to that long       voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his       shattered nerves  they had called upon us that very afternoon  so       that it was natural that the subject should come up for       discussion          the whole course of events   said holmes   from the point of       view of the man who called himself stapleton was simple and       direct  although to us  who had no means in the beginning of       knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of       the facts  it all appeared exceedingly complex  i have had the       advantage of two conversations with mrs  stapleton  and the case       has now been so entirely cleared up that i am not aware that       there is anything which has remained a secret to us  you will       find a few notes upon the matter under the heading b in my       indexed list of cases           perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of       events from memory           certainly  though i cannot guarantee that i carry all the facts       in my mind  intense mental concentration has a curious way of       blotting out what has passed  the barrister who has his case at       his fingers  ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his       own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it       all out of his head once more  so each of my cases displaces the       last  and mlle  car re has blurred my recollection of baskerville       hall  tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my       notice which will in turn dispossess the fair french lady and the       infamous upwood  so far as the case of the hound goes  however  i       will give you the course of events as nearly as i can  and you       will suggest anything which i may have forgotten          my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait       did not lie  and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville  he       was a son of that rodger baskerville  the younger brother of sir       charles  who fled with a sinister reputation to south america        where he was said to have died unmarried  he did  as a matter of       fact  marry  and had one child  this fellow  whose real name is       the same as his father s  he married beryl garcia  one of the       beauties of costa rica  and  having purloined a considerable sum       of public money  he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to       england  where he established a school in the east of yorkshire        his reason for attempting this special line of business was that       he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon       the voyage home  and that he had used this man s ability to make       the undertaking a success  fraser  the tutor  died however  and       the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy        the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to       stapleton  and he brought the remains of his fortune  his schemes       for the future  and his taste for entomology to the south of       england  i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized       authority upon the subject  and that the name of vandeleur has       been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had  in his       yorkshire days  been the first to describe          we now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be       of such intense interest to us  the fellow had evidently made       inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and       a valuable estate  when he went to devonshire his plans were  i       believe  exceedingly hazy  but that he meant mischief from the       first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him       in the character of his sister  the idea of using her as a decoy       was clearly already in his mind  though he may not have been       certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged  he meant       in the end to have the estate  and he was ready to use any tool       or run any risk for that end  his first act was to establish       himself as near to his ancestral home as he could  and his second       was to cultivate a friendship with sir charles baskerville and       with the neighbours          the baronet himself told him about the family hound  and so       prepared the way for his own death  stapleton  as i will continue       to call him  knew that the old man s heart was weak and that a       shock would kill him  so much he had learned from dr  mortimer        he had heard also that sir charles was superstitious and had       taken this grim legend very seriously  his ingenious mind       instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to       death  and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the       guilt to the real murderer          having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with       considerable finesse  an ordinary schemer would have been content       to work with a savage hound  the use of artificial means to make       the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part  the       dog he bought in london from ross and mangles  the dealers in       fulham road  it was the strongest and most savage in their       possession  he brought it down by the north devon line and walked       a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without       exciting any remarks  he had already on his insect hunts learned       to penetrate the grimpen mire  and so had found a safe       hiding place for the creature  here he kennelled it and waited       his chance          but it was some time coming  the old gentleman could not be       decoyed outside of his grounds at night  several times stapleton       lurked about with his hound  but without avail  it was during       these fruitless quests that he  or rather his ally  was seen by       peasants  and that the legend of the demon dog received a new       confirmation  he had hoped that his wife might lure sir charles       to his ruin  but here she proved unexpectedly independent  she       would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a       sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy        threats and even  i am sorry to say  blows refused to move her        she would have nothing to do with it  and for a time stapleton       was at a deadlock          he found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that       sir charles  who had conceived a friendship for him  made him the       minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman        mrs  laura lyons  by representing himself as a single man he       acquired complete influence over her  and he gave her to       understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her       husband he would marry her  his plans were suddenly brought to a       head by his knowledge that sir charles was about to leave the       hall on the advice of dr  mortimer  with whose opinion he himself       pretended to coincide  he must act at once  or his victim might       get beyond his power  he therefore put pressure upon mrs  lyons       to write this letter  imploring the old man to give her an       interview on the evening before his departure for london  he       then  by a specious argument  prevented her from going  and so       had the chance for which he had waited          driving back in the evening from coombe tracey he was in time to       get his hound  to treat it with his infernal paint  and to bring       the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that       he would find the old gentleman waiting  the dog  incited by its       master  sprang over the wicket gate and pursued the unfortunate       baronet  who fled screaming down the yew alley  in that gloomy       tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge       black creature  with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes  bounding       after its victim  he fell dead at the end of the alley from heart       disease and terror  the hound had kept upon the grassy border       while the baronet had run down the path  so that no track but the       man s was visible  on seeing him lying still the creature had       probably approached to sniff at him  but finding him dead had       turned away again  it was then that it left the print which was       actually observed by dr  mortimer  the hound was called off and       hurried away to its lair in the grimpen mire  and a mystery was       left which puzzled the authorities  alarmed the countryside  and       finally brought the case within the scope of our observation          so much for the death of sir charles baskerville  you perceive       the devilish cunning of it  for really it would be almost       impossible to make a case against the real murderer  his only       accomplice was one who could never give him away  and the       grotesque  inconceivable nature of the device only served to make       it more effective  both of the women concerned in the case  mrs        stapleton and mrs  laura lyons  were left with a strong suspicion       against stapleton  mrs  stapleton knew that he had designs upon       the old man  and also of the existence of the hound  mrs  lyons       knew neither of these things  but had been impressed by the death       occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was       only known to him  however  both of them were under his       influence  and he had nothing to fear from them  the first half       of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult       still remained          it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of       an heir in canada  in any case he would very soon learn it from       his friend dr  mortimer  and he was told by the latter all       details about the arrival of henry baskerville  stapleton s first       idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be       done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all        he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in       laying a trap for the old man  and he dared not leave her long       out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her        it was for this reason that he took her to london with him  they       lodged  i find  at the mexborough private hotel  in craven       street  which was actually one of those called upon by my agent       in search of evidence  here he kept his wife imprisoned in her       room while he  disguised in a beard  followed dr  mortimer to       baker street and afterwards to the station and to the       northumberland hotel  his wife had some inkling of his plans  but       she had such a fear of her husband a fear founded upon brutal       ill treatment that she dare not write to warn the man whom she       knew to be in danger  if the letter should fall into stapleton s       hands her own life would not be safe  eventually  as we know  she       adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form       the message  and addressing the letter in a disguised hand  it       reached the baronet  and gave him the first warning of his       danger          it was very essential for stapleton to get some article of sir       henry s attire so that  in case he was driven to use the dog  he       might always have the means of setting him upon his track  with       characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once        and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber maid of the hotel       was well bribed to help him in his design  by chance  however        the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and        therefore  useless for his purpose  he then had it returned and       obtained another a most instructive incident  since it proved       conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound        as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an       old boot and this indifference to a new one  the more  outr   and       grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be       examined  and the very point which appears to complicate a case       is  when duly considered and scientifically handled  the one       which is most likely to elucidate it          then we had the visit from our friends next morning  shadowed       always by stapleton in the cab  from his knowledge of our rooms       and of my appearance  as well as from his general conduct  i am       inclined to think that stapleton s career of crime has been by no       means limited to this single baskerville affair  it is suggestive       that during the last three years there have been four       considerable burglaries in the west country  for none of which       was any criminal ever arrested  the last of these  at folkestone       court  in may  was remarkable for the cold blooded pistolling of       the page  who surprised the masked and solitary burglar  i cannot       doubt that stapleton recruited his waning resources in this       fashion  and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous       man          we had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when       he got away from us so successfully  and also of his audacity in       sending back my own name to me through the cabman  from that       moment he understood that i had taken over the case in london        and that therefore there was no chance for him there  he returned       to dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet           one moment   said i   you have  no doubt  described the sequence       of events correctly  but there is one point which you have left       unexplained  what became of the hound when its master was in       london           i have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly       of importance  there can be no question that stapleton had a       confidant  though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in       his power by sharing all his plans with him  there was an old       manservant at merripit house  whose name was anthony  his       connection with the stapletons can be traced for several years        as far back as the school mastering days  so that he must have       been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and       wife  this man has disappeared and has escaped from the country        it is suggestive that anthony is not a common name in england        while antonio is so in all spanish or spanish american countries        the man  like mrs  stapleton herself  spoke good english  but       with a curious lisping accent  i have myself seen this old man       cross the grimpen mire by the path which stapleton had marked       out  it is very probable  therefore  that in the absence of his       master it was he who cared for the hound  though he may never       have known the purpose for which the beast was used          the stapletons then went down to devonshire  whither they were       soon followed by sir henry and you  one word now as to how i       stood myself at that time  it may possibly recur to your memory       that when i examined the paper upon which the printed words were       fastened i made a close inspection for the water mark  in doing       so i held it within a few inches of my eyes  and was conscious of       a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine  there are       seventy five perfumes  which it is very necessary that a criminal       expert should be able to distinguish from each other  and cases       have more than once within my own experience depended upon their       prompt recognition  the scent suggested the presence of a lady        and already my thoughts began to turn towards the stapletons        thus i had made certain of the hound  and had guessed at the       criminal before ever we went to the west country          it was my game to watch stapleton  it was evident  however  that       i could not do this if i were with you  since he would be keenly       on his guard  i deceived everybody  therefore  yourself included        and i came down secretly when i was supposed to be in london  my       hardships were not so great as you imagined  though such trifling       details must never interfere with the investigation of a case  i       stayed for the most part at coombe tracey  and only used the hut       upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of       action  cartwright had come down with me  and in his disguise as       a country boy he was of great assistance to me  i was dependent       upon him for food and clean linen  when i was watching stapleton        cartwright was frequently watching you  so that i was able to       keep my hand upon all the strings          i have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly        being forwarded instantly from baker street to coombe tracey        they were of great service to me  and especially that one       incidentally truthful piece of biography of stapleton s  i was       able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew       at last exactly how i stood  the case had been considerably       complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the       relations between him and the barrymores  this also you cleared       up in a very effective way  though i had already come to the same       conclusions from my own observations          by the time that you discovered me upon the moor i had a       complete knowledge of the whole business  but i had not a case       which could go to a jury  even stapleton s attempt upon sir henry       that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict       did not help us much in proving murder against our man  there       seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red handed  and to       do so we had to use sir henry  alone and apparently unprotected        as a bait  we did so  and at the cost of a severe shock to our       client we succeeded in completing our case and driving stapleton       to his destruction  that sir henry should have been exposed to       this is  i must confess  a reproach to my management of the case        but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing       spectacle which the beast presented  nor could we predict the fog       which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice  we       succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and       dr  mortimer assure me will be a temporary one  a long journey       may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered       nerves but also from his wounded feelings  his love for the lady       was deep and sincere  and to him the saddest part of all this       black business was that he should have been deceived by her          it only remains to indicate the part which she had played       throughout  there can be no doubt that stapleton exercised an       influence over her which may have been love or may have been       fear  or very possibly both  since they are by no means       incompatible emotions  it was  at least  absolutely effective  at       his command she consented to pass as his sister  though he found       the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her       the direct accessory to murder  she was ready to warn sir henry       so far as she could without implicating her husband  and again       and again she tried to do so  stapleton himself seems to have       been capable of jealousy  and when he saw the baronet paying       court to the lady  even though it was part of his own plan  still       he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which       revealed the fiery soul which his self contained manner so       cleverly concealed  by encouraging the intimacy he made it       certain that sir henry would frequently come to merripit house       and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he       desired  on the day of the crisis  however  his wife turned       suddenly against him  she had learned something of the death of       the convict  and she knew that the hound was being kept in the       outhouse on the evening that sir henry was coming to dinner  she       taxed her husband with his intended crime  and a furious scene       followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a       rival in his love  her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter       hatred  and he saw that she would betray him  he tied her up        therefore  that she might have no chance of warning sir henry        and he hoped  no doubt  that when the whole countryside put down       the baronet s death to the curse of his family  as they certainly       would do  he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished       fact and to keep silent upon what she knew  in this i fancy that       in any case he made a miscalculation  and that  if we had not       been there  his doom would none the less have been sealed  a       woman of spanish blood does not condone such an injury so       lightly  and now  my dear watson  without referring to my notes        i cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case  i       do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained           he could not hope to frighten sir henry to death as he had done       the old uncle with his bogie hound           the beast was savage and half starved  if its appearance did not       frighten its victim to death  at least it would paralyze the       resistance which might be offered           no doubt  there only remains one difficulty  if stapleton came       into the succession  how could he explain the fact that he  the       heir  had been living unannounced under another name so close to       the property  how could he claim it without causing suspicion and       inquiry           it is a formidable difficulty  and i fear that you ask too much       when you expect me to solve it  the past and the present are       within the field of my inquiry  but what a man may do in the       future is a hard question to answer  mrs  stapleton has heard her       husband discuss the problem on several occasions  there were       three possible courses  he might claim the property from south       america  establish his identity before the british authorities       there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to england at       all  or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short       time that he need be in london  or  again  he might furnish an       accomplice with the proofs and papers  putting him in

       "'Chapter 1.\\n\\nMr. Sherlock Holmes\\n\\n      Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings,\\n      save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all\\n      night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the\\n      hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left\\n      behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood,\\n      bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a “Penang lawyer.”\\n      Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch\\n      across. “To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the\\n      C.C.H.,” was engraved upon it, with the date “1884.” It was just\\n      such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to\\n      carry—dignified, solid, and reassuring.\\n\\n      “Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”\\n\\n      Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no\\n      sign of my occupation.\\n\\n      “How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in\\n      the back of your head.”\\n\\n      “I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in\\n      front of me,” said he. “But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of\\n      our visitor’s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss\\n      him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir\\n      becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an\\n      examination of it.”\\n\\n      “I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods of my\\n      companion, “that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical\\n      man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of\\n      their appreciation.”\\n\\n      “Good!” said Holmes. “Excellent!”\\n\\n      “I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a\\n      country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on\\n      foot.”\\n\\n      “Why so?”\\n\\n      “Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has\\n      been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town\\n      practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so\\n      it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with\\n      it.”\\n\\n      “Perfectly sound!” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should\\n      guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose\\n      members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which\\n      has made him a small presentation in return.”\\n\\n      “Really, Watson, you excel yourself,” said Holmes, pushing back\\n      his chair and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound to say that in\\n      all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own\\n      small achievements you have habitually underrated your own\\n      abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you\\n      are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius\\n      have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear\\n      fellow, that I am very much in your debt.”\\n\\n      He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words\\n      gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his\\n      indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had\\n      made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think\\n      that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way\\n      which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands\\n      and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with\\n      an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and\\n      carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a\\n      convex lens.\\n\\n      “Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned to his\\n      favourite corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two\\n      indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several\\n      deductions.”\\n\\n      “Has anything escaped me?” I asked with some self-importance. “I\\n      trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have\\n      overlooked?”\\n\\n      “I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were\\n      erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be\\n      frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided\\n      towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this\\n      instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he\\n      walks a good deal.”\\n\\n      “Then I was right.”\\n\\n      “To that extent.”\\n\\n      “But that was all.”\\n\\n      “No, no, my dear Watson, not all—by no means all. I would\\n      suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more\\n      likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when\\n      the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed before that hospital the words\\n      ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest themselves.”\\n\\n      “You may be right.”\\n\\n      “The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a\\n      working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our\\n      construction of this unknown visitor.”\\n\\n      “Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing\\n      Cross Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”\\n\\n      “Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”\\n\\n      “I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has\\n      practised in town before going to the country.”\\n\\n      “I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look\\n      at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable\\n      that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends\\n      unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the\\n      moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the\\n      hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there\\n      has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from\\n      a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching\\n      our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the\\n      occasion of the change?”\\n\\n      “It certainly seems probable.”\\n\\n      “Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the _staff_\\n      of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London\\n      practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not\\n      drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the\\n      hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a\\n      house-surgeon or a house-physician—little more than a senior\\n      student. And he left five years ago—the date is on the stick. So\\n      your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin\\n      air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under\\n      thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of\\n      a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger\\n      than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.”\\n\\n      I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his\\n      settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.\\n\\n      “As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,” said I,\\n      “but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars\\n      about the man’s age and professional career.” From my small\\n      medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the\\n      name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our\\n      visitor. I read his record aloud.\\n\\n        “Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.\\n        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.\\n        Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with\\n        essay entitled ‘Is Disease a Reversion?’  Corresponding member\\n        of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of ‘Some Freaks of\\n        Atavism’ (_Lancet_ 1882).  ‘Do We Progress?’ (_Journal of\\n        Psychology_, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of\\n        Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.”\\n\\n      “No mention of that local hunt, Watson,” said Holmes with a\\n      mischievous smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely\\n      observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As\\n      to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable,\\n      unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is\\n      only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only\\n      an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,\\n      and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his\\n      visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.”\\n\\n      “And the dog?”\\n\\n      “Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master.\\n      Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle,\\n      and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s\\n      jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in\\n      my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It\\n      may have been—yes, by Jove, it _is_ a curly-haired spaniel.”\\n\\n      He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the\\n      recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his\\n      voice that I glanced up in surprise.\\n\\n      “My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”\\n\\n      “For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our\\n      very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I\\n      beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your\\n      presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment\\n      of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is\\n      walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill.\\n      What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock\\n      Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!”\\n\\n      The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had\\n      expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin\\n      man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two\\n      keen, grey eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from\\n      behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a\\n      professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was\\n      dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was\\n      already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head\\n      and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes\\n      fell upon the stick in Holmes’s hand, and he ran towards it with\\n      an exclamation of joy. “I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not\\n      sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I\\n      would not lose that stick for the world.”\\n\\n      “A presentation, I see,” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “From Charing Cross Hospital?”\\n\\n      “From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.”\\n\\n      “Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Holmes, shaking his head.\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.\\n      “Why was it bad?”\\n\\n      “Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your\\n      marriage, you say?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all\\n      hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home\\n      of my own.”\\n\\n      “Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Holmes.\\n      “And now, Dr. James Mortimer—”\\n\\n      “Mister, sir, Mister—a humble M.R.C.S.”\\n\\n      “And a man of precise mind, evidently.”\\n\\n      “A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the\\n      shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr.\\n      Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not—”\\n\\n      “No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.”\\n\\n      “Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in\\n      connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much,\\n      Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or\\n      such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any\\n      objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A\\n      cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would\\n      be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my\\n      intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.”\\n\\n      Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are\\n      an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am\\n      in mine,” said he. “I observe from your forefinger that you make\\n      your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.”\\n\\n      The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the\\n      other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers\\n      as agile and restless as the antennæ of an insect.\\n\\n      Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the\\n      interest which he took in our curious companion. “I presume,\\n      sir,” said he at last, “that it was not merely for the purpose of\\n      examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here\\n      last night and again today?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of\\n      doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I\\n      recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am\\n      suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary\\n      problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest\\n      expert in Europe—”\\n\\n      “Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?”\\n      asked Holmes with some asperity.\\n\\n      “To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur\\n      Bertillon must always appeal strongly.”\\n\\n      “Then had you not better consult him?”\\n\\n      “I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a\\n      practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.\\n      I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently—”\\n\\n      “Just a little,” said Holmes. “I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would\\n      do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly\\n      what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my\\n      assistance.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2.\\n\\nThe Curse of the Baskervilles\\n\\n      “I have in my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer.\\n\\n      “I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “It is an old manuscript.”\\n\\n      “Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”\\n\\n      “How can you say that, sir?”\\n\\n      “You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all\\n      the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert\\n      who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.\\n      You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject.\\n      I put that at 1730.”\\n\\n      “The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Mortimer drew it from his\\n      breast-pocket. “This family paper was committed to my care by Sir\\n      Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three\\n      months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say\\n      that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant.\\n      He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as\\n      unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very\\n      seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did\\n      eventually overtake him.”\\n\\n      Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it\\n      upon his knee. “You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of\\n      the long _s_ and the short. It is one of several indications\\n      which enabled me to fix the date.”\\n\\n      I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded\\n      script. At the head was written: “Baskerville Hall,” and below in\\n      large, scrawling figures: “1742.”\\n\\n      “It appears to be a statement of some sort.”\\n\\n      “Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the\\n      Baskerville family.”\\n\\n      “But I understand that it is something more modern and practical\\n      upon which you wish to consult me?”\\n\\n      “Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be\\n      decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and\\n      is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I\\n      will read it to you.”\\n\\n      Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,\\n      and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer\\n      turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking\\n      voice the following curious, old-world narrative:\\n\\n        “Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been\\n        many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo\\n        Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also\\n        had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it\\n        occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you\\n        believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may\\n        also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy\\n        but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed.  Learn\\n        then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but\\n        rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul\\n        passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not\\n        again be loosed to our undoing.\\n\\n            “Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the\\n            history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most\\n            earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of\\n            Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be\\n            gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man.\\n             This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing\\n            that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there\\n            was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his\\n            name a by-word through the West.  It chanced that this Hugo\\n            came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known\\n            under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held\\n            lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden,\\n            being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him,\\n            for she feared his evil name.  So it came to pass that one\\n            Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and\\n            wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off\\n            the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he\\n            well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the\\n            maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his\\n            friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly\\n            custom.  Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her\\n            wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths\\n            which came up to her from below, for they say that the\\n            words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were\\n            such as might blast the man who said them.  At last in the\\n            stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted\\n            the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the\\n            growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south\\n            wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward\\n            across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall\\n            and her father’s farm.\\n\\n            “It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his\\n            guests to carry food and drink—with other worse things,\\n            perchance—to his captive, and so found the cage empty and\\n            the bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became as one\\n            that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the\\n            dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and\\n            trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all\\n            the company that he would that very night render his body\\n            and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the\\n            wench.  And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of\\n            the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than\\n            the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon\\n            her.  Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms\\n            that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and\\n            giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid’s, he swung them\\n            to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the\\n            moor.\\n\\n            “Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to\\n            understand all that had been done in such haste.  But anon\\n            their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which\\n            was like to be done upon the moorlands.  Everything was now\\n            in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for\\n            their horses, and some for another flask of wine.  But at\\n            length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the\\n            whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started\\n            in pursuit.  The moon shone clear above them, and they rode\\n            swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must\\n            needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.\\n\\n            “They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the\\n            night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him\\n            to know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as the story\\n            goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak,\\n            but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy\\n            maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  ‘But I have seen\\n            more than that,’ said he, ‘for Hugo Baskerville passed me\\n            upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a\\n            hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.’ \\n            So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward.\\n             But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a\\n            galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with\\n            white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty\\n            saddle.  Then the revellers rode close together, for a\\n            great fear was on them, but they still followed over the\\n            moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been right\\n            glad to have turned his horse’s head.  Riding slowly in\\n            this fashion they came at last upon the hounds.  These,\\n            though known for their valour and their breed, were\\n            whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal,\\n            as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some,\\n            with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the\\n            narrow valley before them.\\n\\n            “The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may\\n            guess, than when they started.  The most of them would by\\n            no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may\\n            be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal. Now, it\\n            opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great\\n            stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain\\n            forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining\\n            bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the\\n            unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of\\n            fatigue.  But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was\\n            it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her,\\n            which raised the hair upon the heads of these three\\n            dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo,\\n            and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a\\n            great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than\\n            any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.  And even\\n            as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo\\n            Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and\\n            dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and\\n            rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor.  One,\\n            it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and\\n            the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their\\n            days.\\n\\n            “Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound\\n            which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever\\n            since.  If I have set it down it is because that which is\\n            clearly known hath less terror than that which is but\\n            hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many of\\n            the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have\\n            been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we shelter\\n            ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which\\n            would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or\\n            fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ.  To\\n            that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I\\n            counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the\\n            moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are\\n            exalted.\\n\\n            “[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,\\n            with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their\\n            sister Elizabeth.]”\\n\\n      When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he\\n      pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr.\\n      Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his\\n      cigarette into the fire.\\n\\n      “Well?” said he.\\n\\n      “Do you not find it interesting?”\\n\\n      “To a collector of fairy tales.”\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.\\n\\n      “Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more\\n      recent. This is the _Devon County Chronicle_ of May 14th of this\\n      year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of\\n      Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that\\n      date.”\\n\\n      My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became\\n      intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:\\n\\n        “The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name\\n        has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for\\n        Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the\\n        county.  Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for\\n        a comparatively short period his amiability of character and\\n        extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who\\n        had been brought into contact with him.  In these days of\\n        _nouveaux riches_ it is refreshing to find a case where the\\n        scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days\\n        is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him\\n        to restore the fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is\\n        well known, made large sums of money in South African\\n        speculation. More wise than those who go on until the wheel\\n        turns against them, he realised his gains and returned to\\n        England with them.  It is only two years since he took up his\\n        residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large\\n        were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have\\n        been interrupted by his death.  Being himself childless, it was\\n        his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,\\n        within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many\\n        will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.  His\\n        generous donations to local and county charities have been\\n        frequently chronicled in these columns.\\n\\n            “The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles\\n            cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the\\n            inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of\\n            those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.\\n            There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to\\n            imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.\\n            Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to\\n            have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In\\n            spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his\\n            personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville\\n            Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the\\n            husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper. Their\\n            evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to\\n            show that Sir Charles’s health has for some time been\\n            impaired, and points especially to some affection of the\\n            heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,\\n            breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.\\n            Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the\\n            deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.\\n\\n            “The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville\\n            was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking\\n            down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The\\n            evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his\\n            custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his\\n            intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered\\n            Barrymore to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out\\n            as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he\\n            was in the habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned. \\n            At twelve o’clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still\\n            open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in\\n            search of his master.  The day had been wet, and Sir\\n            Charles’s footmarks were easily traced down the alley. \\n            Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on\\n            to the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had\\n            stood for some little time here.  He then proceeded down\\n            the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body\\n            was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is\\n            the statement of Barrymore that his master’s footprints\\n            altered their character from the time that he passed the\\n            moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have\\n            been walking upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy\\n            horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the\\n            time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the\\n            worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is\\n            unable to state from what direction they came.  No signs of\\n            violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles’s person,\\n            and though the doctor’s evidence pointed to an almost\\n            incredible facial distortion—so great that Dr. Mortimer\\n            refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend\\n            and patient who lay before him—it was explained that that\\n            is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnœa and\\n            death from cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne\\n            out by the post-mortem examination, which showed\\n            long-standing organic disease, and the coroner’s jury\\n            returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.\\n             It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the\\n            utmost importance that Sir Charles’s heir should settle at\\n            the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly\\n            interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not\\n            finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been\\n            whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been\\n            difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall.  It is\\n            understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,\\n            if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville’s\\n            younger brother.  The young man when last heard of was in\\n            America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to\\n            informing him of his good fortune.”\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket.\\n      “Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the\\n      death of Sir Charles Baskerville.”\\n\\n      “I must thank you,” said Sherlock Holmes, “for calling my\\n      attention to a case which certainly presents some features of\\n      interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but\\n      I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the\\n      Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch\\n      with several interesting English cases. This article, you say,\\n      contains all the public facts?”\\n\\n      “It does.”\\n\\n      “Then let me have the private ones.” He leaned back, put his\\n      finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial\\n      expression.\\n\\n      “In doing so,” said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of\\n      some strong emotion, “I am telling that which I have not confided\\n      to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the coroner’s\\n      inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in\\n      the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition.\\n      I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper\\n      says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to\\n      increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these\\n      reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less\\n      than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but\\n      with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.\\n\\n      “The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near\\n      each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a\\n      good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr.\\n      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist,\\n      there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir\\n      Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought\\n      us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so.\\n      He had brought back much scientific information from South\\n      Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together\\n      discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the\\n      Hottentot.\\n\\n      “Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me\\n      that Sir Charles’s nervous system was strained to the breaking\\n      point. He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly\\n      to heart—so much so that, although he would walk in his own\\n      grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at\\n      night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was\\n      honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and\\n      certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors\\n      were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence\\n      constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has\\n      asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen\\n      any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter\\n      question he put to me several times, and always with a voice\\n      which vibrated with excitement.\\n\\n      “I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some\\n      three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall\\n      door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of\\n      him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and\\n      stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. I\\n      whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something\\n      which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the\\n      drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go\\n      down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for\\n      it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the\\n      worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the\\n      evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion\\n      which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative\\n      which I read to you when first I came. I mention this small\\n      episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy\\n      which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter\\n      was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no\\n      justification.\\n\\n      “It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London.\\n      His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in\\n      which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was\\n      evidently having a serious effect upon his health. I thought that\\n      a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a\\n      new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at\\n      his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the last instant\\n      came this terrible catastrophe.\\n\\n      “On the night of Sir Charles’s death Barrymore the butler, who\\n      made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me,\\n      and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall\\n      within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all the\\n      facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the\\n      footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate\\n      where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the\\n      shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no\\n      other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and\\n      finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched\\n      until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his\\n      fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some\\n      strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn\\n      to his identity. There was certainly no physical injury of any\\n      kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the\\n      inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round\\n      the body. He did not observe any. But I did—some little distance\\n      off, but fresh and clear.”\\n\\n      “Footprints?”\\n\\n      “Footprints.”\\n\\n      “A man’s or a woman’s?”\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice\\n      sank almost to a whisper as he answered.\\n\\n      “Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3.\\n\\nThe Problem\\n\\n      I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a\\n      thrill in the doctor’s voice which showed that he was himself\\n      deeply moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in\\n      his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot\\n      from them when he was keenly interested.\\n\\n      “You saw this?”\\n\\n      “As clearly as I see you.”\\n\\n      “And you said nothing?”\\n\\n      “What was the use?”\\n\\n      “How was it that no one else saw it?”\\n\\n      “The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave\\n      them a thought. I don’t suppose I should have done so had I not\\n      known this legend.”\\n\\n      “There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?”\\n\\n      “No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.”\\n\\n      “You say it was large?”\\n\\n      “Enormous.”\\n\\n      “But it had not approached the body?”\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “What sort of night was it?’\\n\\n      “Damp and raw.”\\n\\n      “But not actually raining?”\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “What is the alley like?”\\n\\n      “There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and\\n      impenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.”\\n\\n      “Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?”\\n\\n      “Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either\\n      side.”\\n\\n      “I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a\\n      gate?”\\n\\n      “Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.”\\n\\n      “Is there any other opening?”\\n\\n      “None.”\\n\\n      “So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it\\n      from the house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?”\\n\\n      “There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.”\\n\\n      “Had Sir Charles reached this?”\\n\\n      “No; he lay about fifty yards from it.”\\n\\n      “Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer—and this is important—the marks which\\n      you saw were on the path and not on the grass?”\\n\\n      “No marks could show on the grass.”\\n\\n      “Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?”\\n\\n      “Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the\\n      moor-gate.”\\n\\n      “You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate\\n      closed?”\\n\\n      “Closed and padlocked.”\\n\\n      “How high was it?”\\n\\n      “About four feet high.”\\n\\n      “Then anyone could have got over it?”\\n\\n      “Yes.”\\n\\n      “And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?”\\n\\n      “None in particular.”\\n\\n      “Good heaven! Did no one examine?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I examined, myself.”\\n\\n      “And found nothing?”\\n\\n      “It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there\\n      for five or ten minutes.”\\n\\n      “How do you know that?”\\n\\n      “Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.”\\n\\n      “Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But\\n      the marks?”\\n\\n      “He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I\\n      could discern no others.”\\n\\n      Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an\\n      impatient gesture.\\n\\n      “If I had only been there!” he cried. “It is evidently a case of\\n      extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense\\n      opportunities to the scientific expert. That gravel page upon\\n      which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by\\n      the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants. Oh, Dr.\\n      Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have called\\n      me in! You have indeed much to answer for.”\\n\\n      “I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these\\n      facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not\\n      wishing to do so. Besides, besides—”\\n\\n      “Why do you hesitate?”\\n\\n      “There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of\\n      detectives is helpless.”\\n\\n      “You mean that the thing is supernatural?”\\n\\n      “I did not positively say so.”\\n\\n      “No, but you evidently think it.”\\n\\n      “Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears\\n      several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled\\n      order of Nature.”\\n\\n      “For example?”\\n\\n      “I find that before the terrible event occurred several people\\n      had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this\\n      Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal\\n      known to science. They all agreed that it was a huge creature,\\n      luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I have cross-examined these men,\\n      one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a\\n      moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful\\n      apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the\\n      legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the\\n      district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at\\n      night.”\\n\\n      “And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be\\n      supernatural?”\\n\\n      “I do not know what to believe.”\\n\\n      Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “I have hitherto confined my\\n      investigations to this world,” said he. “In a modest way I have\\n      combated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would,\\n      perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the\\n      footmark is material.”\\n\\n      “The original hound was material enough to tug a man’s throat\\n      out, and yet he was diabolical as well.”\\n\\n      “I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But\\n      now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why\\n      have you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same\\n      breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles’s death, and\\n      that you desire me to do it.”\\n\\n      “I did not say that I desired you to do it.”\\n\\n      “Then, how can I assist you?”\\n\\n      “By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry\\n      Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Station”—Dr. Mortimer looked\\n      at his watch—“in exactly one hour and a quarter.”\\n\\n      “He being the heir?”\\n\\n      “Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young\\n      gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the\\n      accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every\\n      way. I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and\\n      executor of Sir Charles’s will.”\\n\\n      “There is no other claimant, I presume?”\\n\\n      “None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was\\n      Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor\\n      Sir Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is\\n      the father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black\\n      sheep of the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville\\n      strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family\\n      picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold him, fled to\\n      Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is\\n      the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet\\n      him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at\\n      Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise\\n      me to do with him?”\\n\\n      “Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?”\\n\\n      “It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every\\n      Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure\\n      that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he\\n      would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old\\n      race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet\\n      it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak\\n      countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which\\n      has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is\\n      no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by\\n      my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring\\n      the case before you and ask for your advice.”\\n\\n      Holmes considered for a little time.\\n\\n      “Put into plain words, the matter is this,” said he. “In your\\n      opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an\\n      unsafe abode for a Baskerville—that is your opinion?”\\n\\n      “At least I might go the length of saying that there is some\\n      evidence that this may be so.”\\n\\n      “Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it\\n      could work the young man evil in London as easily as in\\n      Devonshire. A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry\\n      would be too inconceivable a thing.”\\n\\n      “You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would\\n      probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these\\n      things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young\\n      man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty\\n      minutes. What would you recommend?”\\n\\n      “I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who\\n      is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet\\n      Sir Henry Baskerville.”\\n\\n      “And then?”\\n\\n      “And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up\\n      my mind about the matter.”\\n\\n      “How long will it take you to make up your mind?”\\n\\n      “Twenty-four hours. At ten o’clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will\\n      be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will\\n      be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir\\n      Henry Baskerville with you.”\\n\\n      “I will do so, Mr. Holmes.” He scribbled the appointment on his\\n      shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded\\n      fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.\\n\\n      “Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir\\n      Charles Baskerville’s death several people saw this apparition\\n      upon the moor?”\\n\\n      “Three people did.”\\n\\n      “Did any see it after?”\\n\\n      “I have not heard of any.”\\n\\n      “Thank you. Good-morning.”\\n\\n      Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward\\n      satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.\\n\\n      “Going out, Watson?”\\n\\n      “Unless I can help you.”\\n\\n      “No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to\\n      you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points\\n      of view. When you pass Bradley’s, would you ask him to send up a\\n      pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as\\n      well if you could make it convenient not to return before\\n      evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to\\n      this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this\\n      morning.”\\n\\n      I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my\\n      friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during\\n      which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed\\n      alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up\\n      his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial.\\n      I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker\\n      Street until evening. It was nearly nine o’clock when I found\\n      myself in the sitting-room once more.\\n\\n      My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had\\n      broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light\\n      of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered,\\n      however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of\\n      strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me\\n      coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his\\n      dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe\\n      between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.\\n\\n      “Caught cold, Watson?” said he.\\n\\n      “No, it’s this poisonous atmosphere.”\\n\\n      “I suppose it _is_ pretty thick, now that you mention it.”\\n\\n      “Thick! It is intolerable.”\\n\\n      “Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I\\n      perceive.”\\n\\n      “My dear Holmes!”\\n\\n      “Am I right?”\\n\\n      “Certainly, but how?”\\n\\n      He laughed at my bewildered expression. “There is a delightful\\n      freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to\\n      exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense. A\\n      gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns\\n      immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his\\n      boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man\\n      with intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not\\n      obvious?”\\n\\n      “Well, it is rather obvious.”\\n\\n      “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance\\n      ever observes. Where do you think that I have been?”\\n\\n      “A fixture also.”\\n\\n      “On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.”\\n\\n      “In spirit?”\\n\\n      “Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret\\n      to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and\\n      an incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to\\n      Stamford’s for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and\\n      my spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I\\n      could find my way about.”\\n\\n      “A large-scale map, I presume?”\\n\\n      “Very large.”\\n\\n      He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. “Here you have\\n      the particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville\\n      Hall in the middle.”\\n\\n      “With a wood round it?”\\n\\n      “Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that\\n      name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you\\n      perceive, upon the right of it. This small clump of buildings\\n      here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has\\n      his headquarters. Within a radius of five miles there are, as you\\n      see, only a very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall,\\n      which was mentioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated\\n      here which may be the residence of the naturalist—Stapleton, if I\\n      remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farmhouses,\\n      High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the great convict\\n      prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered points\\n      extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage\\n      upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to\\n      play it again.”\\n\\n      “It must be a wild place.”\\n\\n      “Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to\\n      have a hand in the affairs of men—”\\n\\n      “Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural\\n      explanation.”\\n\\n      “The devil’s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?\\n      There are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is\\n      whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what\\n      is the crime and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr.\\n      Mortimer’s surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with\\n      forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of\\n      our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all other\\n      hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we’ll shut\\n      that window again, if you don’t mind. It is a singular thing, but\\n      I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of\\n      thought. I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box\\n      to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions. Have\\n      you turned the case over in your mind?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.”\\n\\n      “What do you make of it?”\\n\\n      “It is very bewildering.”\\n\\n      “It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of\\n      distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.\\n      What do you make of that?”\\n\\n      “Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that\\n      portion of the alley.”\\n\\n      “He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why\\n      should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?”\\n\\n      “What then?”\\n\\n      “He was running, Watson—running desperately, running for his\\n      life, running until he burst his heart—and fell dead upon his\\n      face.”\\n\\n      “Running from what?”\\n\\n      “There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was\\n      crazed with fear before ever he began to run.”\\n\\n      “How can you say that?”\\n\\n      “I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across\\n      the moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man\\n      who had lost his wits would have run _from_ the house instead of\\n      towards it. If the gipsy’s evidence may be taken as true, he ran\\n      with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely\\n      to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why\\n      was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own\\n      house?”\\n\\n      “You think that he was waiting for someone?”\\n\\n      “The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an\\n      evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement.\\n      Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as\\n      Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given\\n      him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?”\\n\\n      “But he went out every evening.”\\n\\n      “I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every\\n      evening. On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the\\n      moor. That night he waited there. It was the night before he made\\n      his departure for London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It\\n      becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we\\n      will postpone all further thought upon this business until we\\n      have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry\\n      Baskerville in the morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4.\\n\\nSir Henry Baskerville\\n\\n      Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his\\n      dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were\\n      punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten\\n      when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet.\\n      The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years\\n      of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a\\n      strong, pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and\\n      had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of\\n      his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his\\n      steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated\\n      the gentleman.\\n\\n      “This is Sir Henry Baskerville,” said Dr. Mortimer.\\n\\n      “Why, yes,” said he, “and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock\\n      Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to\\n      you this morning I should have come on my own account. I\\n      understand that you think out little puzzles, and I’ve had one\\n      this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give\\n      it.”\\n\\n      “Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you\\n      have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in\\n      London?”\\n\\n      “Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as\\n      not. It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which\\n      reached me this morning.”\\n\\n      He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It\\n      was of common quality, greyish in colour. The address, “Sir Henry\\n      Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel,” was printed in rough\\n      characters; the post-mark “Charing Cross,” and the date of\\n      posting the preceding evening.\\n\\n      “Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?” asked\\n      Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.\\n\\n      “No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr.\\n      Mortimer.”\\n\\n      “But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?”\\n\\n      “No, I had been staying with a friend,” said the doctor.\\n\\n      “There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this\\n      hotel.”\\n\\n      “Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your\\n      movements.” Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap\\n      paper folded into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the\\n      table. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed\\n      by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. It ran:\\n\\n        As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.\\n\\n      The word “moor” only was printed in ink.\\n\\n      “Now,” said Sir Henry Baskerville, “perhaps you will tell me, Mr.\\n      Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is\\n      that takes so much interest in my affairs?”\\n\\n      “What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there\\n      is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was\\n      convinced that the business is supernatural.”\\n\\n      “What business?” asked Sir Henry sharply. “It seems to me that\\n      all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own\\n      affairs.”\\n\\n      “You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir\\n      Henry. I promise you that,” said Sherlock Holmes. “We will\\n      confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this\\n      very interesting document, which must have been put together and\\n      posted yesterday evening. Have you yesterday’s _Times_, Watson?”\\n\\n      “It is here in the corner.”\\n\\n      “Might I trouble you for it—the inside page, please, with the\\n      leading articles?” He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes\\n      up and down the columns. “Capital article this on free trade.\\n      Permit me to give you an extract from it.\\n\\n     ‘You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or\\n     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but\\n     it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run\\n     keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our\\n     imports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island.’\\n\\n      “What do you think of that, Watson?” cried Holmes in high glee,\\n      rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. “Don’t you think\\n      that is an admirable sentiment?”\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional\\n      interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark\\n      eyes upon me.\\n\\n      “I don’t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,”\\n      said he, “but it seems to me we’ve got a bit off the trail so far\\n      as that note is concerned.”\\n\\n      “On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail,\\n      Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do,\\n      but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of\\n      this sentence.”\\n\\n      “No, I confess that I see no connection.”\\n\\n      “And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection\\n      that the one is extracted out of the other. ‘You,’ ‘your,’\\n      ‘your,’ ‘life,’ ‘reason,’ ‘value,’ ‘keep away,’ ‘from the.’ Don’t\\n      you see now whence these words have been taken?”\\n\\n      “By thunder, you’re right! Well, if that isn’t smart!” cried Sir\\n      Henry.\\n\\n      “If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that\\n      ‘keep away’ and ‘from the’ are cut out in one piece.”\\n\\n      “Well, now—so it is!”\\n\\n      “Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have\\n      imagined,” said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement.\\n      “I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a\\n      newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came\\n      from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable\\n      things which I have ever known. How did you do it?”\\n\\n      “I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from\\n      that of an Esquimau?”\\n\\n      “Most certainly.”\\n\\n      “But how?”\\n\\n      “Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious.\\n      The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve,\\n      the—”\\n\\n      “But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally\\n      obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the\\n      leaded bourgeois type of a _Times_ article and the slovenly print\\n      of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your\\n      negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the\\n      most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in\\n      crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I\\n      confused the _Leeds Mercury_ with the _Western Morning News_. But\\n      a _Times_ leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could\\n      have been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the\\n      strong probability was that we should find the words in\\n      yesterday’s issue.”\\n\\n      “So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,” said Sir Henry\\n      Baskerville, “someone cut out this message with a scissors—”\\n\\n      “Nail-scissors,” said Holmes. “You can see that it was a very\\n      short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips\\n      over ‘keep away.’”\\n\\n      “That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of\\n      short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste—”\\n\\n      “Gum,” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word ‘moor’\\n      should have been written?”\\n\\n      “Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all\\n      simple and might be found in any issue, but ‘moor’ would be less\\n      common.”\\n\\n      “Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything\\n      else in this message, Mr. Holmes?”\\n\\n      “There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have\\n      been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is\\n      printed in rough characters. But the _Times_ is a paper which is\\n      seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We\\n      may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an\\n      educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his\\n      effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing\\n      might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will\\n      observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but\\n      that some are much higher than others. ‘Life,’ for example is\\n      quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or\\n      it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.\\n      On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was\\n      evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such\\n      a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the\\n      interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any\\n      letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he\\n      would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption—and\\n      from whom?”\\n\\n      “We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,” said Dr.\\n      Mortimer.\\n\\n      “Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and\\n      choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the\\n      imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to\\n      start our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt,\\n      but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a\\n      hotel.”\\n\\n      “How in the world can you say that?”\\n\\n      “If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and\\n      the ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered\\n      twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short\\n      address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle.\\n      Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such\\n      a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. But\\n      you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get\\n      anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that\\n      could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around\\n      Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated _Times_\\n      leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent\\n      this singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What’s this?”\\n\\n      He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words\\n      were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.\\n\\n      “Well?”\\n\\n      “Nothing,” said he, throwing it down. “It is a blank half-sheet\\n      of paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have\\n      drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir\\n      Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you\\n      have been in London?”\\n\\n      “Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.”\\n\\n      “You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?”\\n\\n      “I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,”\\n      said our visitor. “Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch\\n      me?”\\n\\n      “We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us\\n      before we go into this matter?”\\n\\n      “Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.”\\n\\n      “I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth\\n      reporting.”\\n\\n      Sir Henry smiled. “I don’t know much of British life yet, for I\\n      have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I\\n      hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary\\n      routine of life over here.”\\n\\n      “You have lost one of your boots?”\\n\\n      “My dear sir,” cried Dr. Mortimer, “it is only mislaid. You will\\n      find it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of\\n      troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?”\\n\\n      “Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.”\\n\\n      “Exactly,” said Holmes, “however foolish the incident may seem.\\n      You have lost one of your boots, you say?”\\n\\n      “Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last\\n      night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no\\n      sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I\\n      only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never\\n      had them on.”\\n\\n      “If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be\\n      cleaned?”\\n\\n      “They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I\\n      put them out.”\\n\\n      “Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you\\n      went out at once and bought a pair of boots?”\\n\\n      “I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with\\n      me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the\\n      part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways\\n      out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots—gave six\\n      dollars for them—and had one stolen before ever I had them on my\\n      feet.”\\n\\n      “It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,” said Sherlock\\n      Holmes. “I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer’s belief that it\\n      will not be long before the missing boot is found.”\\n\\n      “And, now, gentlemen,” said the baronet with decision, “it seems\\n      to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I\\n      know. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full\\n      account of what we are all driving at.”\\n\\n      “Your request is a very reasonable one,” Holmes answered. “Dr.\\n      Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story\\n      as you told it to us.”\\n\\n      Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his\\n      pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the\\n      morning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest\\n      attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.\\n\\n      “Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,”\\n      said he when the long narrative was finished. “Of course, I’ve\\n      heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. It’s the pet\\n      story of the family, though I never thought of taking it\\n      seriously before. But as to my uncle’s death—well, it all seems\\n      boiling up in my head, and I can’t get it clear yet. You don’t\\n      seem quite to have made up your mind whether it’s a case for a\\n      policeman or a clergyman.”\\n\\n      “Precisely.”\\n\\n      “And now there’s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I\\n      suppose that fits into its place.”\\n\\n      “It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what\\n      goes on upon the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer.\\n\\n      “And also,” said Holmes, “that someone is not ill-disposed\\n      towards you, since they warn you of danger.”\\n\\n      “Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me\\n      away.”\\n\\n      “Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted\\n      to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which\\n      presents several interesting alternatives. But the practical\\n      point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or\\n      is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.”\\n\\n      “Why should I not go?”\\n\\n      “There seems to be danger.”\\n\\n      “Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger\\n      from human beings?”\\n\\n      “Well, that is what we have to find out.”\\n\\n      “Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell,\\n      Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me\\n      from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to\\n      be my final answer.” His dark brows knitted and his face flushed\\n      to a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper\\n      of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last\\n      representative. “Meanwhile,” said he, “I have hardly had time to\\n      think over all that you have told me. It’s a big thing for a man\\n      to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like\\n      to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look\\n      here, Mr. Holmes, it’s half-past eleven now and I am going back\\n      right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson,\\n      come round and lunch with us at two. I’ll be able to tell you\\n      more clearly then how this thing strikes me.”\\n\\n      “Is that convenient to you, Watson?”\\n\\n      “Perfectly.”\\n\\n      “Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?”\\n\\n      “I’d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.”\\n\\n      “I’ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,” said his companion.\\n\\n      “Then we meet again at two o’clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!”\\n\\n      We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang\\n      of the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the\\n      languid dreamer to the man of action.\\n\\n      “Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!” He\\n      rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a\\n      few seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs\\n      and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still\\n      visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of\\n      Oxford Street.\\n\\n      “Shall I run on and stop them?”\\n\\n      “Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with\\n      your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for\\n      it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.”\\n\\n      He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which\\n      divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards\\n      behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street.\\n      Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon\\n      which Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little\\n      cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager\\n      eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted\\n      on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward\\n      again.\\n\\n      “There’s our man, Watson! Come along! We’ll have a good look at\\n      him, if we can do no more.”\\n\\n      At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of\\n      piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.\\n      Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed\\n      to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street.\\n      Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in\\n      sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the\\n      traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out\\n      of sight.\\n\\n      “There now!” said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white\\n      with vexation from the tide of vehicles. “Was ever such bad luck\\n      and such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an\\n      honest man you will record this also and set it against my\\n      successes!”\\n\\n      “Who was the man?”\\n\\n      “I have not an idea.”\\n\\n      “A spy?”\\n\\n      “Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville\\n      has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in\\n      town. How else could it be known so quickly that it was the\\n      Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had followed\\n      him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the\\n      second. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the\\n      window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.”\\n\\n      “Yes, I remember.”\\n\\n      “I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none.\\n      We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very\\n      deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is\\n      a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I\\n      am conscious always of power and design. When our friends left I\\n      at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their\\n      invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted\\n      himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he\\n      could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.\\n      His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take\\n      a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one\\n      obvious disadvantage.”\\n\\n      “It puts him in the power of the cabman.”\\n\\n      “Exactly.”\\n\\n      “What a pity we did not get the number!”\\n\\n      “My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not\\n      seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is\\n      our man. But that is no use to us for the moment.”\\n\\n      “I fail to see how you could have done more.”\\n\\n      “On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked\\n      in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a\\n      second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or,\\n      better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited\\n      there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should\\n      have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and\\n      seeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness,\\n      which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and\\n      energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our\\n      man.”\\n\\n      We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this\\n      conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long\\n      vanished in front of us.\\n\\n      “There is no object in our following them,” said Holmes. “The\\n      shadow has departed and will not return. We must see what further\\n      cards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you\\n      swear to that man’s face within the cab?”\\n\\n      “I could swear only to the beard.”\\n\\n      “And so could I—from which I gather that in all probability it\\n      was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no\\n      use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here,\\n      Watson!”\\n\\n      He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he\\n      was warmly greeted by the manager.\\n\\n      “Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in\\n      which I had the good fortune to help you?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps\\n      my life.”\\n\\n      “My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection,\\n      Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who\\n      showed some ability during the investigation.”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, he is still with us.”\\n\\n      “Could you ring him up?—thank you! And I should be glad to have\\n      change of this five-pound note.”\\n\\n      A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the\\n      summons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence\\n      at the famous detective.\\n\\n      “Let me have the Hotel Directory,” said Holmes. “Thank you! Now,\\n      Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all\\n      in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “You will visit each of these in turn.”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one\\n      shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings.”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of\\n      yesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscarried\\n      and that you are looking for it. You understand?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the\\n      _Times_ with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy\\n      of the _Times_. It is this page. You could easily recognize it,\\n      could you not?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter,\\n      to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three\\n      shillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of\\n      the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned\\n      or removed. In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of\\n      paper and you will look for this page of the _Times_ among it.\\n      The odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten\\n      shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by\\n      wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only\\n      remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman,\\n      No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street\\n      picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the\\n      hotel.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5.\\n\\nThree Broken Threads\\n\\n      Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of\\n      detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in\\n      which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was\\n      entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters.\\n      He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest\\n      ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at\\n      the Northumberland Hotel.\\n\\n      “Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,” said the\\n      clerk. “He asked me to show you up at once when you came.”\\n\\n      “Have you any objection to my looking at your register?” said\\n      Holmes.\\n\\n      “Not in the least.”\\n\\n      The book showed that two names had been added after that of\\n      Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle;\\n      the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.\\n\\n      “Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,” said\\n      Holmes to the porter. “A lawyer, is he not, grey-headed, and\\n      walks with a limp?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active\\n      gentleman, not older than yourself.”\\n\\n      “Surely you are mistaken about his trade?”\\n\\n      “No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very\\n      well known to us.”\\n\\n      “Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the\\n      name. Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend\\n      one finds another.”\\n\\n      “She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of\\n      Gloucester. She always comes to us when she is in town.”\\n\\n      “Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have\\n      established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,” he\\n      continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. “We know\\n      now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not\\n      settled down in his own hotel. That means that while they are, as\\n      we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious\\n      that he should not see them. Now, this is a most suggestive\\n      fact.”\\n\\n      “What does it suggest?”\\n\\n      “It suggests—halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the\\n      matter?”\\n\\n      As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir\\n      Henry Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and\\n      he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was\\n      he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in\\n      a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had\\n      heard from him in the morning.\\n\\n      “Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,” he\\n      cried. “They’ll find they’ve started in to monkey with the wrong\\n      man unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can’t find\\n      my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the\\n      best, Mr. Holmes, but they’ve got a bit over the mark this time.”\\n\\n      “Still looking for your boot?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, and mean to find it.”\\n\\n      “But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?”\\n\\n      “So it was, sir. And now it’s an old black one.”\\n\\n      “What! you don’t mean to say—?”\\n\\n      “That’s just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the\\n      world—the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers,\\n      which I am wearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones,\\n      and today they have sneaked one of the black. Well, have you got\\n      it? Speak out, man, and don’t stand staring!”\\n\\n      An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.\\n\\n      “No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear\\n      no word of it.”\\n\\n      “Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I’ll see the\\n      manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.”\\n\\n      “It shall be found, sir—I promise you that if you will have a\\n      little patience it will be found.”\\n\\n      “Mind it is, for it’s the last thing of mine that I’ll lose in\\n      this den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you’ll excuse my\\n      troubling you about such a trifle—”\\n\\n      “I think it’s well worth troubling about.”\\n\\n      “Why, you look very serious over it.”\\n\\n      “How do you explain it?”\\n\\n      “I just don’t attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest,\\n      queerest thing that ever happened to me.”\\n\\n      “The queerest perhaps—” said Holmes thoughtfully.\\n\\n      “What do you make of it yourself?”\\n\\n      “Well, I don’t profess to understand it yet. This case of yours\\n      is very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your\\n      uncle’s death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of\\n      capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts\\n      so deep. But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds\\n      are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. We may\\n      waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we\\n      must come upon the right.”\\n\\n      We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the\\n      business which had brought us together. It was in the private\\n      sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked\\n      Baskerville what were his intentions.\\n\\n      “To go to Baskerville Hall.”\\n\\n      “And when?”\\n\\n      “At the end of the week.”\\n\\n      “On the whole,” said Holmes, “I think that your decision is a\\n      wise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in\\n      London, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult\\n      to discover who these people are or what their object can be. If\\n      their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we\\n      should be powerless to prevent it. You did not know, Dr.\\n      Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?”\\n\\n      Dr. Mortimer started violently. “Followed! By whom?”\\n\\n      “That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among\\n      your neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a\\n      black, full beard?”\\n\\n      “No—or, let me see—why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles’s butler, is\\n      a man with a full, black beard.”\\n\\n      “Ha! Where is Barrymore?”\\n\\n      “He is in charge of the Hall.”\\n\\n      “We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any\\n      possibility he might be in London.”\\n\\n      “How can you do that?”\\n\\n      “Give me a telegraph form. ‘Is all ready for Sir Henry?’ That\\n      will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the\\n      nearest telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a\\n      second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: ‘Telegram to Mr.\\n      Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, please\\n      return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.’ That\\n      should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his\\n      post in Devonshire or not.”\\n\\n      “That’s so,” said Baskerville. “By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is\\n      this Barrymore, anyhow?”\\n\\n      “He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have\\n      looked after the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know,\\n      he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the\\n      county.”\\n\\n      “At the same time,” said Baskerville, “it’s clear enough that so\\n      long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people\\n      have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.”\\n\\n      “That is true.”\\n\\n      “Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles’s will?” asked\\n      Holmes.\\n\\n      “He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.”\\n\\n      “Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?”\\n\\n      “Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions\\n      of his will.”\\n\\n      “That is very interesting.”\\n\\n      “I hope,” said Dr. Mortimer, “that you do not look with\\n      suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir\\n      Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me.”\\n\\n      “Indeed! And anyone else?”\\n\\n      “There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large\\n      number of public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.”\\n\\n      “And how much was the residue?”\\n\\n      “Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.”\\n\\n      Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. “I had no idea that so\\n      gigantic a sum was involved,” said he.\\n\\n      “Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not\\n      know how very rich he was until we came to examine his\\n      securities. The total value of the estate was close on to a\\n      million.”\\n\\n      “Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a\\n      desperate game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing\\n      that anything happened to our young friend here—you will forgive\\n      the unpleasant hypothesis!—who would inherit the estate?”\\n\\n      “Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles’s younger brother died\\n      unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are\\n      distant cousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in\\n      Westmoreland.”\\n\\n      “Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met\\n      Mr. James Desmond?”\\n\\n      “Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of\\n      venerable appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he\\n      refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he\\n      pressed it upon him.”\\n\\n      “And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles’s\\n      thousands.”\\n\\n      “He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He\\n      would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed\\n      otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he\\n      likes with it.”\\n\\n      “And have you made your will, Sir Henry?”\\n\\n      “No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I’ve had no time, for it was only\\n      yesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I\\n      feel that the money should go with the title and estate. That was\\n      my poor uncle’s idea. How is the owner going to restore the\\n      glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up\\n      the property? House, land, and dollars must go together.”\\n\\n      “Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the\\n      advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay.\\n      There is only one provision which I must make. You certainly must\\n      not go alone.”\\n\\n      “Dr. Mortimer returns with me.”\\n\\n      “But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is\\n      miles away from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he may\\n      be unable to help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you\\n      someone, a trusty man, who will be always by your side.”\\n\\n      “Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?”\\n\\n      “If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in\\n      person; but you can understand that, with my extensive consulting\\n      practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many\\n      quarters, it is impossible for me to be absent from London for an\\n      indefinite time. At the present instant one of the most revered\\n      names in England is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I\\n      can stop a disastrous scandal. You will see how impossible it is\\n      for me to go to Dartmoor.”\\n\\n      “Whom would you recommend, then?”\\n\\n      Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. “If my friend would undertake\\n      it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when\\n      you are in a tight place. No one can say so more confidently than\\n      I.”\\n\\n      The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had\\n      time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it\\n      heartily.\\n\\n      “Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,” said he. “You\\n      see how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter\\n      as I do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me\\n      through I’ll never forget it.”\\n\\n      The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I\\n      was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with\\n      which the baronet hailed me as a companion.\\n\\n      “I will come, with pleasure,” said I. “I do not know how I could\\n      employ my time better.”\\n\\n      “And you will report very carefully to me,” said Holmes. “When a\\n      crisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I\\n      suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?”\\n\\n      “Would that suit Dr. Watson?”\\n\\n      “Perfectly.”\\n\\n      “Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet\\n      at the ten-thirty train from Paddington.”\\n\\n      We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry of triumph,\\n      and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown\\n      boot from under a cabinet.\\n\\n      “My missing boot!” he cried.\\n\\n      “May all our difficulties vanish as easily!” said Sherlock\\n      Holmes.\\n\\n      “But it is a very singular thing,” Dr. Mortimer remarked. “I\\n      searched this room carefully before lunch.”\\n\\n      “And so did I,” said Baskerville. “Every inch of it.”\\n\\n      “There was certainly no boot in it then.”\\n\\n      “In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were\\n      lunching.”\\n\\n      The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the\\n      matter, nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been\\n      added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small\\n      mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting\\n      aside the whole grim story of Sir Charles’s death, we had a line\\n      of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days,\\n      which included the receipt of the printed letter, the\\n      black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot,\\n      the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new\\n      brown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to\\n      Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that\\n      his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some\\n      scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected\\n      episodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late into the evening\\n      he sat lost in tobacco and thought.\\n\\n      Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:\\n\\n      Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.\\n\\n      The second:\\n\\n      Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry to report\\n      unable to trace cut sheet of _Times_. CARTWRIGHT.\\n\\n      “There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more\\n      stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. We\\n      must cast round for another scent.”\\n\\n      “We have still the cabman who drove the spy.”\\n\\n      “Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the\\n      Official Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an\\n      answer to my question.”\\n\\n      The ring at the bell proved to be something even more\\n      satisfactory than an answer, however, for the door opened and a\\n      rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself.\\n\\n      “I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address\\n      had been inquiring for No. 2704,” said he. “I’ve driven my cab\\n      this seven years and never a word of complaint. I came here\\n      straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had\\n      against me.”\\n\\n      “I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,” said\\n      Holmes. “On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you\\n      will give me a clear answer to my questions.”\\n\\n      “Well, I’ve had a good day and no mistake,” said the cabman with\\n      a grin. “What was it you wanted to ask, sir?”\\n\\n      “First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.”\\n\\n      “John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of\\n      Shipley’s Yard, near Waterloo Station.”\\n\\n      Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.\\n\\n      “Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched\\n      this house at ten o’clock this morning and afterwards followed\\n      the two gentlemen down Regent Street.”\\n\\n      The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. “Why, there’s\\n      no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I\\n      do already,” said he. “The truth is that the gentleman told me\\n      that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about him\\n      to anyone.”\\n\\n      “My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may\\n      find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide\\n      anything from me. You say that your fare told you that he was a\\n      detective?”\\n\\n      “Yes, he did.”\\n\\n      “When did he say this?”\\n\\n      “When he left me.”\\n\\n      “Did he say anything more?”\\n\\n      “He mentioned his name.”\\n\\n      Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. “Oh, he mentioned\\n      his name, did he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he\\n      mentioned?”\\n\\n      “His name,” said the cabman, “was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”\\n\\n      Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by\\n      the cabman’s reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement.\\n      Then he burst into a hearty laugh.\\n\\n      “A touch, Watson—an undeniable touch!” said he. “I feel a foil as\\n      quick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily\\n      that time. So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, that was the gentleman’s name.”\\n\\n      “Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that\\n      occurred.”\\n\\n      “He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that\\n      he was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do\\n      exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad\\n      enough to agree. First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel\\n      and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from\\n      the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near\\n      here.”\\n\\n      “This very door,” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “Well, I couldn’t be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew\\n      all about it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an\\n      hour and a half. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and\\n      we followed down Baker Street and along—”\\n\\n      “I know,” said Holmes.\\n\\n      “Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my\\n      gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive\\n      right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped\\n      up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes. Then he paid\\n      up his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into the\\n      station. Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said:\\n      ‘It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr.\\n      Sherlock Holmes.’ That’s how I come to know the name.”\\n\\n      “I see. And you saw no more of him?”\\n\\n      “Not after he went into the station.”\\n\\n      “And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”\\n\\n      The cabman scratched his head. “Well, he wasn’t altogether such\\n      an easy gentleman to describe. I’d put him at forty years of age,\\n      and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than\\n      you, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard,\\n      cut square at the end, and a pale face. I don’t know as I could\\n      say more than that.”\\n\\n      “Colour of his eyes?”\\n\\n      “No, I can’t say that.”\\n\\n      “Nothing more that you can remember?”\\n\\n      “No, sir; nothing.”\\n\\n      “Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There’s another one\\n      waiting for you if you can bring any more information.\\n      Good-night!”\\n\\n      “Good-night, sir, and thank you!”\\n\\n      John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a\\n      shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile.\\n\\n      “Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,” said he.\\n      “The cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry\\n      Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,\\n      conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my\\n      hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. I\\n      tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of\\n      our steel. I’ve been checkmated in London. I can only wish you\\n      better luck in Devonshire. But I’m not easy in my mind about it.”\\n\\n      “About what?”\\n\\n      “About sending you. It’s an ugly business, Watson, an ugly\\n      dangerous business, and the more I see of it the less I like it.\\n      Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I\\n      shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker\\n      Street once more.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6.\\n\\nBaskerville Hall\\n\\n      Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the\\n      appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr.\\n      Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last\\n      parting injunctions and advice.\\n\\n      “I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,\\n      Watson,” said he; “I wish you simply to report facts in the\\n      fullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the\\n      theorizing.”\\n\\n      “What sort of facts?” I asked.\\n\\n      “Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon\\n      the case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville\\n      and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death\\n      of Sir Charles. I have made some inquiries myself in the last few\\n      days, but the results have, I fear, been negative. One thing only\\n      appears to be certain, and that is that Mr. James Desmond, who is\\n      the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable\\n      disposition, so that this persecution does not arise from him. I\\n      really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our\\n      calculations. There remain the people who will actually surround\\n      Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.”\\n\\n      “Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this\\n      Barrymore couple?”\\n\\n      “By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are\\n      innocent it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we\\n      should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. No,\\n      no, we will preserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there\\n      is a groom at the Hall, if I remember right. There are two\\n      moorland farmers. There is our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I\\n      believe to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we\\n      know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton, and there is\\n      his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions. There\\n      is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,\\n      and there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who\\n      must be your very special study.”\\n\\n      “I will do my best.”\\n\\n      “You have arms, I suppose?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I thought it as well to take them.”\\n\\n      “Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and\\n      never relax your precautions.”\\n\\n      Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were\\n      waiting for us upon the platform.\\n\\n      “No, we have no news of any kind,” said Dr. Mortimer in answer to\\n      my friend’s questions. “I can swear to one thing, and that is\\n      that we have not been shadowed during the last two days. We have\\n      never gone out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could\\n      have escaped our notice.”\\n\\n      “You have always kept together, I presume?”\\n\\n      “Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pure\\n      amusement when I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the\\n      College of Surgeons.”\\n\\n      “And I went to look at the folk in the park,” said Baskerville.\\n\\n      “But we had no trouble of any kind.”\\n\\n      “It was imprudent, all the same,” said Holmes, shaking his head\\n      and looking very grave. “I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go\\n      about alone. Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did\\n      you get your other boot?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, it is gone forever.”\\n\\n      “Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,” he added as\\n      the train began to glide down the platform. “Bear in mind, Sir\\n      Henry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr.\\n      Mortimer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those hours of\\n      darkness when the powers of evil are exalted.”\\n\\n      I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and\\n      saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and\\n      gazing after us.\\n\\n      The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in\\n      making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in\\n      playing with Dr. Mortimer’s spaniel. In a very few hours the\\n      brown earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite,\\n      and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields where the lush grasses\\n      and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer, if a damper,\\n      climate. Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and\\n      cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features\\n      of the Devon scenery.\\n\\n      “I’ve been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr.\\n      Watson,” said he; “but I have never seen a place to compare with\\n      it.”\\n\\n      “I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county,” I\\n      remarked.\\n\\n      “It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the\\n      county,” said Dr. Mortimer. “A glance at our friend here reveals\\n      the rounded head of the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic\\n      enthusiasm and power of attachment. Poor Sir Charles’s head was\\n      of a very rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in its\\n      characteristics. But you were very young when you last saw\\n      Baskerville Hall, were you not?”\\n\\n      “I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father’s death and had\\n      never seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the\\n      South Coast. Thence I went straight to a friend in America. I\\n      tell you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I’m\\n      as keen as possible to see the moor.”\\n\\n      “Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your\\n      first sight of the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the\\n      carriage window.\\n\\n      Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood\\n      there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a\\n      strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some\\n      fantastic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long time,\\n      his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much\\n      it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the\\n      men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so\\n      deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American accent,\\n      in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I looked\\n      at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a\\n      descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and\\n      masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his\\n      thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If\\n      on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should\\n      lie before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one might\\n      venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely\\n      share it.\\n\\n      The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all\\n      descended. Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with\\n      a pair of cobs was waiting. Our coming was evidently a great\\n      event, for station-master and porters clustered round us to carry\\n      out our luggage. It was a sweet, simple country spot, but I was\\n      surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly\\n      men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and\\n      glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a hard-faced,\\n      gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a\\n      few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road.\\n      Rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old\\n      gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but\\n      behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark\\n      against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor,\\n      broken by the jagged and sinister hills.\\n\\n      The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward\\n      through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on\\n      either side, heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart’s-tongue\\n      ferns. Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light\\n      of the sinking sun. Still steadily rising, we passed over a\\n      narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed\\n      swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the grey boulders. Both\\n      road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak\\n      and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of\\n      delight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless\\n      questions. To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of\\n      melancholy lay upon the countryside, which bore so clearly the\\n      mark of the waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and\\n      fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our wheels\\n      died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation—sad\\n      gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the\\n      carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.\\n\\n      “Halloa!” cried Dr. Mortimer, “what is this?”\\n\\n      A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor,\\n      lay in front of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an\\n      equestrian statue upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark\\n      and stern, his rifle poised ready over his forearm. He was\\n      watching the road along which we travelled.\\n\\n      “What is this, Perkins?” asked Dr. Mortimer.\\n\\n      Our driver half turned in his seat. “There’s a convict escaped\\n      from Princetown, sir. He’s been out three days now, and the\\n      warders watch every road and every station, but they’ve had no\\n      sight of him yet. The farmers about here don’t like it, sir, and\\n      that’s a fact.”\\n\\n      “Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give\\n      information.”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing\\n      compared to the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it\\n      isn’t like any ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick\\n      at nothing.”\\n\\n      “Who is he, then?”\\n\\n      “It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.”\\n\\n      I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had\\n      taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the\\n      crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions\\n      of the assassin. The commutation of his death sentence had been\\n      due to some doubts as to his complete sanity, so atrocious was\\n      his conduct. Our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us\\n      rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with gnarled and\\n      craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from it and set us\\n      shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking\\n      this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his\\n      heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast\\n      him out. It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness\\n      of the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky.\\n      Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely\\n      around him.\\n\\n      We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked\\n      back on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the\\n      streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new\\n      turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands. The\\n      road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and\\n      olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now and then we\\n      passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with no\\n      creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into\\n      a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which\\n      had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two\\n      high, narrow towers rose over the trees. The driver pointed with\\n      his whip.\\n\\n      “Baskerville Hall,” said he.\\n\\n      Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and\\n      shining eyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates,\\n      a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten\\n      pillars on either side, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by\\n      the boars’ heads of the Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of\\n      black granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a new\\n      building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles’s\\n      South African gold.\\n\\n      Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels\\n      were again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their\\n      branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered\\n      as he looked up the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered\\n      like a ghost at the farther end.\\n\\n      “Was it here?” he asked in a low voice.\\n\\n      “No, no, the yew alley is on the other side.”\\n\\n      The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.\\n\\n      “It’s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in\\n      such a place as this,” said he. “It’s enough to scare any man.\\n      I’ll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months,\\n      and you won’t know it again, with a thousand candle-power Swan\\n      and Edison right here in front of the hall door.”\\n\\n      The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay\\n      before us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a\\n      heavy block of building from which a porch projected. The whole\\n      front was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there\\n      where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil.\\n      From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient,\\n      crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To right and left of\\n      the turrets were more modern wings of black granite. A dull light\\n      shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys\\n      which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single\\n      black column of smoke.\\n\\n      “Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!”\\n\\n      A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the\\n      door of the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted\\n      against the yellow light of the hall. She came out and helped the\\n      man to hand down our bags.\\n\\n      “You don’t mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?” said Dr.\\n      Mortimer. “My wife is expecting me.”\\n\\n      “Surely you will stay and have some dinner?”\\n\\n      “No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I\\n      would stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a\\n      better guide than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to\\n      send for me if I can be of service.”\\n\\n      The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned\\n      into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a\\n      fine apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and\\n      heavily raftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In the\\n      great old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a\\n      log-fire crackled and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands\\n      to it, for we were numb from our long drive. Then we gazed round\\n      us at the high, thin window of old stained glass, the oak\\n      panelling, the stags’ heads, the coats of arms upon the walls,\\n      all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp.\\n\\n      “It’s just as I imagined it,” said Sir Henry. “Is it not the very\\n      picture of an old family home? To think that this should be the\\n      same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived.\\n      It strikes me solemn to think of it.”\\n\\n      I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed\\n      about him. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long\\n      shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above\\n      him. Barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms.\\n      He stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a\\n      well-trained servant. He was a remarkable-looking man, tall,\\n      handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished\\n      features.\\n\\n      “Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?”\\n\\n      “Is it ready?”\\n\\n      “In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your\\n      rooms. My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you\\n      until you have made your fresh arrangements, but you will\\n      understand that under the new conditions this house will require\\n      a considerable staff.”\\n\\n      “What new conditions?”\\n\\n      “I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and\\n      we were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish\\n      to have more company, and so you will need changes in your\\n      household.”\\n\\n      “Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?”\\n\\n      “Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.”\\n\\n      “But your family have been with us for several generations, have\\n      they not? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an\\n      old family connection.”\\n\\n      I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler’s white\\n      face.\\n\\n      “I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the\\n      truth, sir, we were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and\\n      his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very\\n      painful to us. I fear that we shall never again be easy in our\\n      minds at Baskerville Hall.”\\n\\n      “But what do you intend to do?”\\n\\n      “I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing\\n      ourselves in some business. Sir Charles’s generosity has given us\\n      the means to do so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to\\n      your rooms.”\\n\\n      A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,\\n      approached by a double stair. From this central point two long\\n      corridors extended the whole length of the building, from which\\n      all the bedrooms opened. My own was in the same wing as\\n      Baskerville’s and almost next door to it. These rooms appeared to\\n      be much more modern than the central part of the house, and the\\n      bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the\\n      sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind.\\n\\n      But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of\\n      shadow and gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating\\n      the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for\\n      their dependents. At one end a minstrel’s gallery overlooked it.\\n      Black beams shot across above our heads, with a smoke-darkened\\n      ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches to light it up,\\n      and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might\\n      have softened; but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in\\n      the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one’s voice\\n      became hushed and one’s spirit subdued. A dim line of ancestors,\\n      in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the\\n      buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by their\\n      silent company. We talked little, and I for one was glad when the\\n      meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern\\n      billiard-room and smoke a cigarette.\\n\\n      “My word, it isn’t a very cheerful place,” said Sir Henry. “I\\n      suppose one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the\\n      picture at present. I don’t wonder that my uncle got a little\\n      jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this. However, if\\n      it suits you, we will retire early tonight, and perhaps things\\n      may seem more cheerful in the morning.”\\n\\n      I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from\\n      my window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of\\n      the hall door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a\\n      rising wind. A half moon broke through the rifts of racing\\n      clouds. In its cold light I saw beyond the trees a broken fringe\\n      of rocks, and the long, low curve of the melancholy moor. I\\n      closed the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in\\n      keeping with the rest.\\n\\n      And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet\\n      wakeful, tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the\\n      sleep which would not come. Far away a chiming clock struck out\\n      the quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay\\n      upon the old house. And then suddenly, in the very dead of the\\n      night, there came a sound to my ears, clear, resonant, and\\n      unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling\\n      gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow. I sat up in\\n      bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been far away\\n      and was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with\\n      every nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the\\n      chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7.\\n\\nThe Stapletons of Merripit House\\n\\n      The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface\\n      from our minds the grim and grey impression which had been left\\n      upon both of us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As\\n      Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through\\n      the high mullioned windows, throwing watery patches of colour\\n      from the coats of arms which covered them. The dark panelling\\n      glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard to realise\\n      that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom\\n      into our souls upon the evening before.\\n\\n      “I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to\\n      blame!” said the baronet. “We were tired with our journey and\\n      chilled by our drive, so we took a grey view of the place. Now we\\n      are fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more.”\\n\\n      “And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,” I\\n      answered. “Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman\\n      I think, sobbing in the night?”\\n\\n      “That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I\\n      heard something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was\\n      no more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.”\\n\\n      “I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob\\n      of a woman.”\\n\\n      “We must ask about this right away.” He rang the bell and asked\\n      Barrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed\\n      to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler\\n      still as he listened to his master’s question.\\n\\n      “There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,” he answered.\\n      “One is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The\\n      other is my wife, and I can answer for it that the sound could\\n      not have come from her.”\\n\\n      And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after\\n      breakfast I met Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun\\n      full upon her face. She was a large, impassive, heavy-featured\\n      woman with a stern set expression of mouth. But her telltale eyes\\n      were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids. It was she,\\n      then, who wept in the night, and if she did so her husband must\\n      know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in\\n      declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did\\n      she weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome,\\n      black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery\\n      and of gloom. It was he who had been the first to discover the\\n      body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the\\n      circumstances which led up to the old man’s death. Was it\\n      possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen in\\n      the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the\\n      same. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such\\n      an impression might easily have been erroneous. How could I\\n      settle the point forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to\\n      see the Grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had\\n      really been placed in Barrymore’s own hands. Be the answer what\\n      it might, I should at least have something to report to Sherlock\\n      Holmes.\\n\\n      Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that\\n      the time was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk\\n      of four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a\\n      small grey hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to\\n      be the inn and the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the\\n      rest. The postmaster, who was also the village grocer, had a\\n      clear recollection of the telegram.\\n\\n      “Certainly, sir,” said he, “I had the telegram delivered to Mr.\\n      Barrymore exactly as directed.”\\n\\n      “Who delivered it?”\\n\\n      “My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore\\n      at the Hall last week, did you not?”\\n\\n      “Yes, father, I delivered it.”\\n\\n      “Into his own hands?” I asked.\\n\\n      “Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put\\n      it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore’s hands,\\n      and she promised to deliver it at once.”\\n\\n      “Did you see Mr. Barrymore?”\\n\\n      “No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.”\\n\\n      “If you didn’t see him, how do you know he was in the loft?”\\n\\n      “Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,” said the\\n      postmaster testily. “Didn’t he get the telegram? If there is any\\n      mistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.”\\n\\n      It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was\\n      clear that in spite of Holmes’s ruse we had no proof that\\n      Barrymore had not been in London all the time. Suppose that it\\n      were so—suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen\\n      Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when he\\n      returned to England. What then? Was he the agent of others or had\\n      he some sinister design of his own? What interest could he have\\n      in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the strange\\n      warning clipped out of the leading article of the _Times_. Was\\n      that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was\\n      bent upon counteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive\\n      was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the\\n      family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home\\n      would be secured for the Barrymores. But surely such an\\n      explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the\\n      deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible\\n      net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that no more\\n      complex case had come to him in all the long series of his\\n      sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the\\n      grey, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his\\n      preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of\\n      responsibility from my shoulders.\\n\\n      Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running\\n      feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned,\\n      expecting to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a\\n      stranger who was pursuing me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven,\\n      prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and lean-jawed, between thirty and\\n      forty years of age, dressed in a grey suit and wearing a straw\\n      hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and\\n      he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands.\\n\\n      “You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,” said he\\n      as he came panting up to where I stood. “Here on the moor we are\\n      homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions. You may\\n      possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I\\n      am Stapleton, of Merripit House.”\\n\\n      “Your net and box would have told me as much,” said I, “for I\\n      knew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know\\n      me?”\\n\\n      “I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me\\n      from the window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the\\n      same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce\\n      myself. I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his\\n      journey?”\\n\\n      “He is very well, thank you.”\\n\\n      “We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir\\n      Charles the new baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking\\n      much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of\\n      this kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very great\\n      deal to the countryside. Sir Henry has, I suppose, no\\n      superstitious fears in the matter?”\\n\\n      “I do not think that it is likely.”\\n\\n      “Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the\\n      family?”\\n\\n      “I have heard it.”\\n\\n      “It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here!\\n      Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a\\n      creature upon the moor.” He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to\\n      read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously. “The\\n      story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and\\n      I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end.”\\n\\n      “But how?”\\n\\n      “His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog\\n      might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy\\n      that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night\\n      in the yew alley. I feared that some disaster might occur, for I\\n      was very fond of the old man, and I knew that his heart was\\n      weak.”\\n\\n      “How did you know that?”\\n\\n      “My friend Mortimer told me.”\\n\\n      “You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he\\n      died of fright in consequence?”\\n\\n      “Have you any better explanation?”\\n\\n      “I have not come to any conclusion.”\\n\\n      “Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”\\n\\n      The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the\\n      placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no\\n      surprise was intended.\\n\\n      “It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr.\\n      Watson,” said he. “The records of your detective have reached us\\n      here, and you could not celebrate him without being known\\n      yourself. When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny your\\n      identity. If you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock\\n      Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally\\n      curious to know what view he may take.”\\n\\n      “I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.”\\n\\n      “May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?”\\n\\n      “He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage\\n      his attention.”\\n\\n      “What a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark\\n      to us. But as to your own researches, if there is any possible\\n      way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will\\n      command me. If I had any indication of the nature of your\\n      suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, I might\\n      perhaps even now give you some aid or advice.”\\n\\n      “I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend,\\n      Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.”\\n\\n      “Excellent!” said Stapleton. “You are perfectly right to be wary\\n      and discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an\\n      unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not\\n      mention the matter again.”\\n\\n      We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from\\n      the road and wound away across the moor. A steep,\\n      boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone\\n      days been cut into a granite quarry. The face which was turned\\n      towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growing\\n      in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a grey\\n      plume of smoke.\\n\\n      “A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit\\n      House,” said he. “Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have\\n      the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.”\\n\\n      My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry’s side. But\\n      then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his\\n      study table was littered. It was certain that I could not help\\n      with those. And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the\\n      neighbours upon the moor. I accepted Stapleton’s invitation, and\\n      we turned together down the path.\\n\\n      “It is a wonderful place, the moor,” said he, looking round over\\n      the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged\\n      granite foaming up into fantastic surges. “You never tire of the\\n      moor. You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains.\\n      It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious.”\\n\\n      “You know it well, then?”\\n\\n      “I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a\\n      newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my\\n      tastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and I\\n      should think that there are few men who know it better than I\\n      do.”\\n\\n      “Is it hard to know?”\\n\\n      “Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north\\n      here with the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe\\n      anything remarkable about that?”\\n\\n      “It would be a rare place for a gallop.”\\n\\n      “You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several\\n      their lives before now. You notice those bright green spots\\n      scattered thickly over it?”\\n\\n      “Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.”\\n\\n      Stapleton laughed. “That is the great Grimpen Mire,” said he. “A\\n      false step yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I\\n      saw one of the moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I\\n      saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole,\\n      but it sucked him down at last. Even in dry seasons it is a\\n      danger to cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awful\\n      place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and\\n      return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable\\n      ponies!”\\n\\n      Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges.\\n      Then a long, agonised, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful\\n      cry echoed over the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my\\n      companion’s nerves seemed to be stronger than mine.\\n\\n      “It’s gone!” said he. “The mire has him. Two in two days, and\\n      many more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the\\n      dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them\\n      in its clutches. It’s a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.”\\n\\n      “And you say you can penetrate it?”\\n\\n      “Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can\\n      take. I have found them out.”\\n\\n      “But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?”\\n\\n      “Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off\\n      on all sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them\\n      in the course of years. That is where the rare plants and the\\n      butterflies are, if you have the wit to reach them.”\\n\\n      “I shall try my luck some day.”\\n\\n      He looked at me with a surprised face. “For God’s sake put such\\n      an idea out of your mind,” said he. “Your blood would be upon my\\n      head. I assure you that there would not be the least chance of\\n      your coming back alive. It is only by remembering certain complex\\n      landmarks that I am able to do it.”\\n\\n      “Halloa!” I cried. “What is that?”\\n\\n      A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It\\n      filled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it\\n      came. From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then\\n      sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again.\\n      Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face.\\n\\n      “Queer place, the moor!” said he.\\n\\n      “But what is it?”\\n\\n      “The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for\\n      its prey. I’ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so\\n      loud.”\\n\\n      I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge\\n      swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing\\n      stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which\\n      croaked loudly from a tor behind us.\\n\\n      “You are an educated man. You don’t believe such nonsense as\\n      that?” said I. “What do you think is the cause of so strange a\\n      sound?”\\n\\n      “Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It’s the mud settling, or the\\n      water rising, or something.”\\n\\n      “No, no, that was a living voice.”\\n\\n      “Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?”\\n\\n      “No, I never did.”\\n\\n      “It’s a very rare bird—practically extinct—in England now, but\\n      all things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be\\n      surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last\\n      of the bitterns.”\\n\\n      “It’s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my\\n      life.”\\n\\n      “Yes, it’s rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the\\n      hillside yonder. What do you make of those?”\\n\\n      The whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings of\\n      stone, a score of them at least.\\n\\n      “What are they? Sheep-pens?”\\n\\n      “No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man\\n      lived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived\\n      there since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as he\\n      left them. These are his wigwams with the roofs off. You can even\\n      see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go\\n      inside.\\n\\n      “But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?”\\n\\n      “Neolithic man—no date.”\\n\\n      “What did he do?”\\n\\n      “He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for\\n      tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look\\n      at the great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes,\\n      you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr.\\n      Watson. Oh, excuse me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides.”\\n\\n      A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an\\n      instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed\\n      in pursuit of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the\\n      great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an instant,\\n      bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the\\n      air. His grey clothes and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made\\n      him not unlike some huge moth himself. I was standing watching\\n      his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary\\n      activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the\\n      treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning\\n      round, found a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the\\n      direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of\\n      Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was\\n      quite close.\\n\\n      I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had\\n      been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor,\\n      and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a\\n      beauty. The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a\\n      most uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast\\n      between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted,\\n      with light hair and grey eyes, while she was darker than any\\n      brunette whom I have seen in England—slim, elegant, and tall. She\\n      had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have\\n      seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the\\n      beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant\\n      dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely\\n      moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then\\n      she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat and was\\n      about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned\\n      all my thoughts into a new channel.\\n\\n      “Go back!” she said. “Go straight back to London, instantly.”\\n\\n      I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at\\n      me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.\\n\\n      “Why should I go back?” I asked.\\n\\n      “I cannot explain.” She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a\\n      curious lisp in her utterance. “But for God’s sake do what I ask\\n      you. Go back and never set foot upon the moor again.”\\n\\n      “But I have only just come.”\\n\\n      “Man, man!” she cried. “Can you not tell when a warning is for\\n      your own good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from\\n      this place at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word\\n      of what I have said. Would you mind getting that orchid for me\\n      among the mare’s-tails yonder? We are very rich in orchids on the\\n      moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties\\n      of the place.”\\n\\n      Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing\\n      hard and flushed with his exertions.\\n\\n      “Halloa, Beryl!” said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of\\n      his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.\\n\\n      “Well, Jack, you are very hot.”\\n\\n      “Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom\\n      found in the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed\\n      him!” He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced\\n      incessantly from the girl to me.\\n\\n      “You have introduced yourselves, I can see.”\\n\\n      “Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to\\n      see the true beauties of the moor.”\\n\\n      “Why, who do you think this is?”\\n\\n      “I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.”\\n\\n      “No, no,” said I. “Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My\\n      name is Dr. Watson.”\\n\\n      A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. “We have\\n      been talking at cross purposes,” said she.\\n\\n      “Why, you had not very much time for talk,” her brother remarked\\n      with the same questioning eyes.\\n\\n      “I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being\\n      merely a visitor,” said she. “It cannot much matter to him\\n      whether it is early or late for the orchids. But you will come\\n      on, will you not, and see Merripit House?”\\n\\n      A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the\\n      farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into\\n      repair and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded\\n      it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and\\n      nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean and\\n      melancholy. We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated\\n      old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house. Inside,\\n      however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in\\n      which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I looked\\n      from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor\\n      rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel\\n      at what could have brought this highly educated man and this\\n      beautiful woman to live in such a place.\\n\\n      “Queer spot to choose, is it not?” said he as if in answer to my\\n      thought. “And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we\\n      not, Beryl?”\\n\\n      “Quite happy,” said she, but there was no ring of conviction in\\n      her words.\\n\\n      “I had a school,” said Stapleton. “It was in the north country.\\n      The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and\\n      uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping\\n      to mould those young minds, and of impressing them with one’s own\\n      character and ideals was very dear to me. However, the fates were\\n      against us. A serious epidemic broke out in the school and three\\n      of the boys died. It never recovered from the blow, and much of\\n      my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet, if it were\\n      not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, I\\n      could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes\\n      for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here,\\n      and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr.\\n      Watson, has been brought upon your head by your expression as you\\n      surveyed the moor out of our window.”\\n\\n      “It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little\\n      dull—less for you, perhaps, than for your sister.”\\n\\n      “No, no, I am never dull,” said she quickly.\\n\\n      “We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting\\n      neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line.\\n      Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. We knew him\\n      well and miss him more than I can tell. Do you think that I\\n      should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the\\n      acquaintance of Sir Henry?”\\n\\n      “I am sure that he would be delighted.”\\n\\n      “Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may\\n      in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him\\n      until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you\\n      come upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection of\\n      Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in the\\n      south-west of England. By the time that you have looked through\\n      them lunch will be almost ready.”\\n\\n      But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the\\n      moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which\\n      had been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all\\n      these things tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of\\n      these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite\\n      and distinct warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such\\n      intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave and\\n      deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all pressure to stay for\\n      lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking the\\n      grass-grown path by which we had come.\\n\\n      It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for\\n      those who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was\\n      astounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side\\n      of the track. Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions\\n      and she held her hand to her side.\\n\\n      “I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,”\\n      said she. “I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop,\\n      or my brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am\\n      about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir\\n      Henry. Please forget the words I said, which have no application\\n      whatever to you.”\\n\\n      “But I can’t forget them, Miss Stapleton,” said I. “I am Sir\\n      Henry’s friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine.\\n      Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should\\n      return to London.”\\n\\n      “A woman’s whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will\\n      understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or\\n      do.”\\n\\n      “No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look\\n      in your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton,\\n      for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows\\n      all round me. Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with\\n      little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with\\n      no guide to point the track. Tell me then what it was that you\\n      meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry.”\\n\\n      An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her\\n      face, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.\\n\\n      “You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,” said she. “My brother and\\n      I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him\\n      very intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our\\n      house. He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the\\n      family, and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there\\n      must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was\\n      distressed therefore when another member of the family came down\\n      to live here, and I felt that he should be warned of the danger\\n      which he will run. That was all which I intended to convey.\\n\\n      “But what is the danger?”\\n\\n      “You know the story of the hound?”\\n\\n      “I do not believe in such nonsense.”\\n\\n      “But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him\\n      away from a place which has always been fatal to his family. The\\n      world is wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of\\n      danger?”\\n\\n      “Because it _is_ the place of danger. That is Sir Henry’s nature.\\n      I fear that unless you can give me some more definite information\\n      than this it would be impossible to get him to move.”\\n\\n      “I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything\\n      definite.”\\n\\n      “I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant\\n      no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not\\n      wish your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to\\n      which he, or anyone else, could object.”\\n\\n      “My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he\\n      thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He\\n      would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which\\n      might induce Sir Henry to go away. But I have done my duty now\\n      and I will say no more. I must go back, or he will miss me and\\n      suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!” She turned and had\\n      disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while\\n      I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to\\n      Baskerville Hall.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8.\\n\\nFirst Report of Dr. Watson\\n\\n      From this point onward I will follow the course of events by\\n      transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie\\n      before me on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they\\n      are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the\\n      moment more accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these\\n      tragic events, can possibly do.\\n\\n      Baskerville Hall, October 13th.\\n\\n      MY DEAR HOLMES,\\n\\n      My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to\\n      date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner\\n      of the world. The longer one stays here the more does the spirit\\n      of the moor sink into one’s soul, its vastness, and also its grim\\n      charm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all\\n      traces of modern England behind you, but, on the other hand, you\\n      are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the\\n      prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the\\n      houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge\\n      monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As you\\n      look at their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides you\\n      leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a\\n      skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a\\n      flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel\\n      that his presence there was more natural than your own. The\\n      strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what\\n      must always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian,\\n      but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried\\n      race who were forced to accept that which none other would\\n      occupy.\\n\\n      All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me\\n      and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely\\n      practical mind. I can still remember your complete indifference\\n      as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round\\n      the sun. Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir\\n      Henry Baskerville.\\n\\n      If you have not had any report within the last few days it is\\n      because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate.\\n      Then a very surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell\\n      you in due course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touch\\n      with some of the other factors in the situation.\\n\\n      One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped\\n      convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that\\n      he has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the\\n      lonely householders of this district. A fortnight has passed\\n      since his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing\\n      has been heard of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could\\n      have held out upon the moor during all that time. Of course, so\\n      far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all. Any\\n      one of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place. But there\\n      is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of\\n      the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone, and the\\n      outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.\\n\\n      We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could\\n      take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy\\n      moments when I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles\\n      from any help. There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister,\\n      and the brother, the latter not a very strong man. They would be\\n      helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this Notting\\n      Hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance. Both Sir Henry\\n      and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested\\n      that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, but\\n      Stapleton would not hear of it.\\n\\n      The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a\\n      considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be\\n      wondered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an\\n      active man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful\\n      woman. There is something tropical and exotic about her which\\n      forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother.\\n      Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires. He has certainly a\\n      very marked influence over her, for I have seen her continually\\n      glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what\\n      she said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is a dry glitter\\n      in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a\\n      positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an\\n      interesting study.\\n\\n      He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the\\n      very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the\\n      legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It\\n      was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which\\n      is so dismal that it might have suggested the story. We found a\\n      short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy\\n      space flecked over with the white cotton grass. In the middle of\\n      it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end\\n      until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous\\n      beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old\\n      tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more\\n      than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the\\n      interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke\\n      lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest.\\n      Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that\\n      he said less than he might, and that he would not express his\\n      whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the\\n      baronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had suffered\\n      from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that\\n      he shared the popular view upon the matter.\\n\\n      On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was\\n      there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton.\\n      From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly\\n      attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not\\n      mutual. He referred to her again and again on our walk home, and\\n      since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen\\n      something of the brother and sister. They dine here tonight, and\\n      there is some talk of our going to them next week. One would\\n      imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and\\n      yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest\\n      disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some\\n      attention to his sister. He is much attached to her, no doubt,\\n      and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the\\n      height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her\\n      making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that he does not\\n      wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times\\n      observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being\\n      _tête-à-tête_. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow\\n      Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a\\n      love affair were to be added to our other difficulties. My\\n      popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders\\n      to the letter.\\n\\n      The other day—Thursday, to be more exact—Dr. Mortimer lunched\\n      with us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got\\n      a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. Never was\\n      there such a single-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came\\n      in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley\\n      at Sir Henry’s request to show us exactly how everything occurred\\n      upon that fatal night. It is a long, dismal walk, the yew alley,\\n      between two high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of\\n      grass upon either side. At the far end is an old tumble-down\\n      summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where the old\\n      gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with a\\n      latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of\\n      the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old\\n      man stood there he saw something coming across the moor,\\n      something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran\\n      and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion. There was\\n      the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. And from what? A\\n      sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and\\n      monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter? Did the pale,\\n      watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was all dim\\n      and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind\\n      it.\\n\\n      One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.\\n      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south\\n      of us. He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and\\n      choleric. His passion is for the British law, and he has spent a\\n      large fortune in litigation. He fights for the mere pleasure of\\n      fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a\\n      question, so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly\\n      amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the\\n      parish to make him open it. At others he will with his own hands\\n      tear down some other man’s gate and declare that a path has\\n      existed there from time immemorial, defying the owner to\\n      prosecute him for trespass. He is learned in old manorial and\\n      communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour\\n      of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so\\n      that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the\\n      village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest\\n      exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands\\n      at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his\\n      fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the\\n      future. Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured\\n      person, and I only mention him because you were particular that I\\n      should send some description of the people who surround us. He is\\n      curiously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer,\\n      he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roof\\n      of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of\\n      catching a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would confine\\n      his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours\\n      that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave\\n      without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the\\n      Neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our\\n      lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where\\n      it is badly needed.\\n\\n      And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict,\\n      the Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let\\n      me end on that which is most important and tell you more about\\n      the Barrymores, and especially about the surprising development\\n      of last night.\\n\\n      First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London\\n      in order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have\\n      already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that\\n      the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the\\n      other. I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in\\n      his downright fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether he\\n      had received the telegram himself. Barrymore said that he had.\\n\\n      “Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?” asked Sir Henry.\\n\\n      Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.\\n\\n      “No,” said he, “I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife\\n      brought it up to me.”\\n\\n      “Did you answer it yourself?”\\n\\n      “No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write\\n      it.”\\n\\n      In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.\\n\\n      “I could not quite understand the object of your questions this\\n      morning, Sir Henry,” said he. “I trust that they do not mean that\\n      I have done anything to forfeit your confidence?”\\n\\n      Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by\\n      giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London\\n      outfit having now all arrived.\\n\\n      Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid\\n      person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be\\n      puritanical. You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject.\\n      Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard her\\n      sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed\\n      traces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her\\n      heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts\\n      her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic\\n      tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular and\\n      questionable in this man’s character, but the adventure of last\\n      night brings all my suspicions to a head.\\n\\n      And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that\\n      I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in\\n      this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night,\\n      about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step\\n      passing my room. I rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A long\\n      black shadow was trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a\\n      man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his\\n      hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet.\\n      I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it\\n      was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there\\n      was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole\\n      appearance.\\n\\n      I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which\\n      runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther\\n      side. I waited until he had passed out of sight and then I\\n      followed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached the\\n      end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of\\n      light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms.\\n      Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his\\n      expedition became more mysterious than ever. The light shone\\n      steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the\\n      passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of\\n      the door.\\n\\n      Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held\\n      against the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and\\n      his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out\\n      into the blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood\\n      watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with an\\n      impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my way\\n      back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing\\n      once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had\\n      fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock,\\n      but I could not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I\\n      cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this\\n      house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom\\n      of. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to\\n      furnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir\\n      Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded\\n      upon my observations of last night. I will not speak about it\\n      just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9.\\n\\nThe Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Watson]\\n\\n      Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th.\\n\\n      MY DEAR HOLMES,\\n\\n      If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the\\n      early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up\\n      for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast\\n      upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note with\\n      Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already\\n      which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you.\\n      Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In\\n      some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much\\n      clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated. But I\\n      will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself.\\n\\n      Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went\\n      down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had\\n      been on the night before. The western window through which he had\\n      stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all\\n      other windows in the house—it commands the nearest outlook on to\\n      the moor. There is an opening between two trees which enables one\\n      from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from\\n      all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be\\n      obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this\\n      window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for\\n      something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so\\n      that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone.\\n      It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was\\n      on foot. That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and\\n      also for the uneasiness of his wife. The man is a\\n      striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of\\n      a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to\\n      support it. That opening of the door which I had heard after I\\n      had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep\\n      some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the\\n      morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however\\n      much the result may have shown that they were unfounded.\\n\\n      But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore’s movements might\\n      be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself\\n      until I could explain them was more than I could bear. I had an\\n      interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I\\n      told him all that I had seen. He was less surprised than I had\\n      expected.\\n\\n      “I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to\\n      speak to him about it,” said he. “Two or three times I have heard\\n      his steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour\\n      you name.”\\n\\n      “Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular\\n      window,” I suggested.\\n\\n      “Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see\\n      what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes\\n      would do if he were here.”\\n\\n      “I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,” said\\n      I. “He would follow Barrymore and see what he did.”\\n\\n      “Then we shall do it together.”\\n\\n      “But surely he would hear us.”\\n\\n      “The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance\\n      of that. We’ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he\\n      passes.” Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was\\n      evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat\\n      quiet life upon the moor.\\n\\n      The baronet has been in communication with the architect who\\n      prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from\\n      London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon.\\n      There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, and\\n      it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare\\n      no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. When\\n      the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need\\n      will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there are\\n      pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is\\n      willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a\\n      woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton.\\n      And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as\\n      one would under the circumstances expect. Today, for example, its\\n      surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused\\n      our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance.\\n\\n      After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir\\n      Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of\\n      course I did the same.\\n\\n      “What, are _you_ coming, Watson?” he asked, looking at me in a\\n      curious way.\\n\\n      “That depends on whether you are going on the moor,” said I.\\n\\n      “Yes, I am.”\\n\\n      “Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude,\\n      but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not\\n      leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the\\n      moor.”\\n\\n      Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.\\n\\n      “My dear fellow,” said he, “Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not\\n      foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the\\n      moor. You understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in\\n      the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out\\n      alone.”\\n\\n      It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say\\n      or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his\\n      cane and was gone.\\n\\n      But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached\\n      me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my\\n      sight. I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to\\n      you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my\\n      disregard for your instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed\\n      at the very thought. It might not even now be too late to\\n      overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit\\n      House.\\n\\n      I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing\\n      anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor\\n      path branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the\\n      wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could\\n      command a view—the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry.\\n      Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor path about a quarter\\n      of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss\\n      Stapleton. It was clear that there was already an understanding\\n      between them and that they had met by appointment. They were\\n      walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making\\n      quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest\\n      in what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or\\n      twice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks\\n      watching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next. To\\n      follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to\\n      be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to\\n      let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend was a\\n      hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observe\\n      him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to\\n      him afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden\\n      danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and\\n      yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was\\n      very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do.\\n\\n      Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and\\n      were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was\\n      suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their\\n      interview. A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and\\n      another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man\\n      who was moving among the broken ground. It was Stapleton with his\\n      butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was,\\n      and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this instant\\n      Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was\\n      round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from\\n      him with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she\\n      raised one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring\\n      apart and turn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the\\n      interruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net\\n      dangling behind him. He gesticulated and almost danced with\\n      excitement in front of the lovers. What the scene meant I could\\n      not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir\\n      Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the\\n      other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in haughty\\n      silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a\\n      peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at\\n      Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother. The\\n      naturalist’s angry gestures showed that the lady was included in\\n      his displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute looking after\\n      them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come,\\n      his head hanging, the very picture of dejection.\\n\\n      What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed\\n      to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend’s\\n      knowledge. I ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at\\n      the bottom. His face was flushed with anger and his brows were\\n      wrinkled, like one who is at his wit’s ends what to do.\\n\\n      “Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?” said he. “You\\n      don’t mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?”\\n\\n      I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to\\n      remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed\\n      all that had occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but\\n      my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a\\n      rather rueful laugh.\\n\\n      “You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe\\n      place for a man to be private,” said he, “but, by thunder, the\\n      whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my\\n      wooing—and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a\\n      seat?”\\n\\n      “I was on that hill.”\\n\\n      “Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the\\n      front. Did you see him come out on us?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I did.”\\n\\n      “Did he ever strike you as being crazy—this brother of hers?”\\n\\n      “I can’t say that he ever did.”\\n\\n      “I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today,\\n      but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a\\n      straitjacket. What’s the matter with me, anyhow? You’ve lived\\n      near me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there\\n      anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a\\n      woman that I loved?”\\n\\n      “I should say not.”\\n\\n      “He can’t object to my worldly position, so it must be myself\\n      that he has this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt\\n      man or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not so\\n      much as let me touch the tips of her fingers.”\\n\\n      “Did he say so?”\\n\\n      “That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I’ve only known her\\n      these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made\\n      for me, and she, too—she was happy when she was with me, and that\\n      I’ll swear. There’s a light in a woman’s eyes that speaks louder\\n      than words. But he has never let us get together and it was only\\n      today for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few\\n      words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did\\n      it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn’t have\\n      let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She\\n      kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that\\n      she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that\\n      since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if\\n      she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her\\n      to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to\\n      marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of\\n      hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just\\n      white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with\\n      fury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her\\n      attentions which were distasteful to her? Did I think that\\n      because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had not\\n      been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As\\n      it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such\\n      as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour\\n      me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better,\\n      so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more\\n      hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing\\n      by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here\\n      am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me\\n      what it all means, Watson, and I’ll owe you more than ever I can\\n      hope to pay.”\\n\\n      I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely\\n      puzzled myself. Our friend’s title, his fortune, his age, his\\n      character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know\\n      nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his\\n      family. That his advances should be rejected so brusquely without\\n      any reference to the lady’s own wishes and that the lady should\\n      accept the situation without protest is very amazing. However,\\n      our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton\\n      himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies for\\n      his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview\\n      with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was\\n      that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at\\n      Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it.\\n\\n      “I don’t say now that he isn’t a crazy man,” said Sir Henry; “I\\n      can’t forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning,\\n      but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology\\n      than he has done.”\\n\\n      “Did he give any explanation of his conduct?”\\n\\n      “His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural\\n      enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value. They\\n      have always been together, and according to his account he has\\n      been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the\\n      thought of losing her was really terrible to him. He had not\\n      understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but\\n      when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she\\n      might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for a\\n      time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He was very\\n      sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and\\n      how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a\\n      beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If\\n      she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like\\n      myself than to anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him\\n      and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself\\n      to meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I\\n      would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be\\n      content with cultivating the lady’s friendship during that time\\n      without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the matter\\n      rests.”\\n\\n      So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is\\n      something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we\\n      are floundering. We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour\\n      upon his sister’s suitor—even when that suitor was so eligible a\\n      one as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to another thread which I\\n      have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs\\n      in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the\\n      secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window.\\n      Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not\\n      disappointed you as an agent—that you do not regret the\\n      confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All\\n      these things have by one night’s work been thoroughly cleared.\\n\\n      I have said “by one night’s work,” but, in truth, it was by two\\n      nights’ work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up\\n      with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o’clock in the\\n      morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming\\n      clock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy vigil and ended\\n      by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately we were\\n      not discouraged, and we determined to try again. The next night\\n      we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the\\n      least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by,\\n      and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient\\n      interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into\\n      which he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we\\n      had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an\\n      instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary\\n      senses keenly on the alert once more. We had heard the creak of a\\n      step in the passage.\\n\\n      Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the\\n      distance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out\\n      in pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the\\n      corridor was all in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had\\n      come into the other wing. We were just in time to catch a glimpse\\n      of the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded as he\\n      tiptoed down the passage. Then he passed through the same door as\\n      before, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and\\n      shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor. We\\n      shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every plank before we\\n      dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the\\n      precaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old\\n      boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed\\n      impossible that he should fail to hear our approach. However, the\\n      man is fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied\\n      in that which he was doing. When at last we reached the door and\\n      peeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle in\\n      hand, his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly as\\n      I had seen him two nights before.\\n\\n      We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to\\n      whom the most direct way is always the most natural. He walked\\n      into the room, and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the\\n      window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood, livid and\\n      trembling, before us. His dark eyes, glaring out of the white\\n      mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he\\n      gazed from Sir Henry to me.\\n\\n      “What are you doing here, Barrymore?”\\n\\n      “Nothing, sir.” His agitation was so great that he could hardly\\n      speak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his\\n      candle. “It was the window, sir. I go round at night to see that\\n      they are fastened.”\\n\\n      “On the second floor?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, all the windows.”\\n\\n      “Look here, Barrymore,” said Sir Henry sternly, “we have made up\\n      our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you\\n      trouble to tell it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies!\\n      What were you doing at that window?”\\n\\n      The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands\\n      together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and\\n      misery.\\n\\n      “I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.”\\n\\n      “And why were you holding a candle to the window?”\\n\\n      “Don’t ask me, Sir Henry—don’t ask me! I give you my word, sir,\\n      that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it\\n      concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you.”\\n\\n      A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the\\n      trembling hand of the butler.\\n\\n      “He must have been holding it as a signal,” said I. “Let us see\\n      if there is any answer.” I held it as he had done, and stared out\\n      into the darkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black\\n      bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the\\n      moon was behind the clouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation,\\n      for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the\\n      dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square\\n      framed by the window.\\n\\n      “There it is!” I cried.\\n\\n      “No, no, sir, it is nothing—nothing at all!” the butler broke in;\\n      “I assure you, sir—”\\n\\n      “Move your light across the window, Watson!” cried the baronet.\\n      “See, the other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it\\n      is a signal? Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder,\\n      and what is this conspiracy that is going on?”\\n\\n      The man’s face became openly defiant. “It is my business, and not\\n      yours. I will not tell.”\\n\\n      “Then you leave my employment right away.”\\n\\n      “Very good, sir. If I must I must.”\\n\\n      “And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of\\n      yourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred\\n      years under this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot\\n      against me.”\\n\\n      “No, no, sir; no, not against you!” It was a woman’s voice, and\\n      Mrs. Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband,\\n      was standing at the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt\\n      might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling\\n      upon her face.\\n\\n      “We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our\\n      things,” said the butler.\\n\\n      “Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing, Sir\\n      Henry—all mine. He has done nothing except for my sake and\\n      because I asked him.”\\n\\n      “Speak out, then! What does it mean?”\\n\\n      “My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let him\\n      perish at our very gates. The light is a signal to him that food\\n      is ready for him, and his light out yonder is to show the spot to\\n      which to bring it.”\\n\\n      “Then your brother is—”\\n\\n      “The escaped convict, sir—Selden, the criminal.”\\n\\n      “That’s the truth, sir,” said Barrymore. “I said that it was not\\n      my secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have\\n      heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not\\n      against you.”\\n\\n      This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at\\n      night and the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at\\n      the woman in amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly\\n      respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most\\n      notorious criminals in the country?\\n\\n      “Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We\\n      humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way\\n      in everything until he came to think that the world was made for\\n      his pleasure, and that he could do what he liked in it. Then as\\n      he grew older he met wicked companions, and the devil entered\\n      into him until he broke my mother’s heart and dragged our name in\\n      the dirt. From crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is\\n      only the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold;\\n      but to me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy that I\\n      had nursed and played with as an elder sister would. That was why\\n      he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and that we could\\n      not refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here one night,\\n      weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what\\n      could we do? We took him in and fed him and cared for him. Then\\n      you returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on\\n      the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he\\n      lay in hiding there. But every second night we made sure if he\\n      was still there by putting a light in the window, and if there\\n      was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him.\\n      Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long as he was there\\n      we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I am an\\n      honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in\\n      the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose\\n      sake he has done all that he has.”\\n\\n      The woman’s words came with an intense earnestness which carried\\n      conviction with them.\\n\\n      “Is this true, Barrymore?”\\n\\n      “Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.”\\n\\n      “Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget\\n      what I have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk\\n      further about this matter in the morning.”\\n\\n      When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry\\n      had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our\\n      faces. Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one\\n      tiny point of yellow light.\\n\\n      “I wonder he dares,” said Sir Henry.\\n\\n      “It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.”\\n\\n      “Very likely. How far do you think it is?”\\n\\n      “Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.”\\n\\n      “Not more than a mile or two off.”\\n\\n      “Hardly that.”\\n\\n      “Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to\\n      it. And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By\\n      thunder, Watson, I am going out to take that man!”\\n\\n      The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the\\n      Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had\\n      been forced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an\\n      unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse.\\n      We were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him\\n      back where he could do no harm. With his brutal and violent\\n      nature, others would have to pay the price if we held our hands.\\n      Any night, for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might be\\n      attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this which\\n      made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.\\n\\n      “I will come,” said I.\\n\\n      “Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we\\n      start the better, as the fellow may put out his light and be\\n      off.”\\n\\n      In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our\\n      expedition. We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull\\n      moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves.\\n      The night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and\\n      again the moon peeped out for an instant, but clouds were driving\\n      over the face of the sky, and just as we came out on the moor a\\n      thin rain began to fall. The light still burned steadily in\\n      front.\\n\\n      “Are you armed?” I asked.\\n\\n      “I have a hunting-crop.”\\n\\n      “We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a\\n      desperate fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at\\n      our mercy before he can resist.”\\n\\n      “I say, Watson,” said the baronet, “what would Holmes say to\\n      this? How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil\\n      is exalted?”\\n\\n      As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast\\n      gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon\\n      the borders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind\\n      through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a\\n      rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away. Again\\n      and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident,\\n      wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve and his face\\n      glimmered white through the darkness.\\n\\n      “My God, what’s that, Watson?”\\n\\n      “I don’t know. It’s a sound they have on the moor. I heard it\\n      once before.”\\n\\n      It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood\\n      straining our ears, but nothing came.\\n\\n      “Watson,” said the baronet, “it was the cry of a hound.”\\n\\n      My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice\\n      which told of the sudden horror which had seized him.\\n\\n      “What do they call this sound?” he asked.\\n\\n      “Who?”\\n\\n      “The folk on the countryside.”\\n\\n      “Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call\\n      it?”\\n\\n      “Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?”\\n\\n      I hesitated but could not escape the question.\\n\\n      “They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.”\\n\\n      He groaned and was silent for a few moments.\\n\\n      “A hound it was,” he said at last, “but it seemed to come from\\n      miles away, over yonder, I think.”\\n\\n      “It was hard to say whence it came.”\\n\\n      “It rose and fell with the wind. Isn’t that the direction of the\\n      great Grimpen Mire?”\\n\\n      “Yes, it is.”\\n\\n      “Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn’t you think\\n      yourself that it was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You\\n      need not fear to speak the truth.”\\n\\n      “Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it\\n      might be the calling of a strange bird.”\\n\\n      “No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all\\n      these stories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so\\n      dark a cause? You don’t believe it, do you, Watson?”\\n\\n      “No, no.”\\n\\n      “And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is\\n      another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear\\n      such a cry as that. And my uncle! There was the footprint of the\\n      hound beside him as he lay. It all fits together. I don’t think\\n      that I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze my\\n      very blood. Feel my hand!”\\n\\n      It was as cold as a block of marble.\\n\\n      “You’ll be all right tomorrow.”\\n\\n      “I don’t think I’ll get that cry out of my head. What do you\\n      advise that we do now?”\\n\\n      “Shall we turn back?”\\n\\n      “No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do\\n      it. We after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not,\\n      after us. Come on! We’ll see it through if all the fiends of the\\n      pit were loose upon the moor.”\\n\\n      We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of\\n      the craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning\\n      steadily in front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance\\n      of a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer\\n      seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might\\n      have been within a few yards of us. But at last we could see\\n      whence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed very close.\\n      A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which\\n      flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also\\n      to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of\\n      Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach,\\n      and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It\\n      was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle\\n      of the moor, with no sign of life near it—just the one straight\\n      yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it.\\n\\n      “What shall we do now?” whispered Sir Henry.\\n\\n      “Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a\\n      glimpse of him.”\\n\\n      The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over\\n      the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was\\n      thrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all\\n      seamed and scored with vile passions. Foul with mire, with a\\n      bristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well have\\n      belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on\\n      the hillsides. The light beneath him was reflected in his small,\\n      cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the\\n      darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps\\n      of the hunters.\\n\\n      Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been\\n      that Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to\\n      give, or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking\\n      that all was not well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked\\n      face. Any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the\\n      darkness. I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same.\\n      At the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and\\n      hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had\\n      sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, strongly\\n      built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run. At the\\n      same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.\\n      We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man\\n      running with great speed down the other side, springing over the\\n      stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky\\n      long shot of my revolver might have crippled him, but I had\\n      brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an\\n      unarmed man who was running away.\\n\\n      We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we\\n      soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him\\n      for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck\\n      moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant\\n      hill. We ran and ran until we were completely blown, but the\\n      space between us grew ever wider. Finally we stopped and sat\\n      panting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in the\\n      distance.\\n\\n      And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and\\n      unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to\\n      go home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low\\n      upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up\\n      against the lower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as\\n      black as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw the\\n      figure of a man upon the tor. Do not think that it was a\\n      delusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never in my life seen\\n      anything more clearly. As far as I could judge, the figure was\\n      that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs a little\\n      separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were\\n      brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which\\n      lay before him. He might have been the very spirit of that\\n      terrible place. It was not the convict. This man was far from the\\n      place where the latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much\\n      taller man. With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the\\n      baronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp\\n      his arm the man was gone. There was the sharp pinnacle of granite\\n      still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but its peak bore no\\n      trace of that silent and motionless figure.\\n\\n      I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it\\n      was some distance away. The baronet’s nerves were still quivering\\n      from that cry, which recalled the dark story of his family, and\\n      he was not in the mood for fresh adventures. He had not seen this\\n      lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his\\n      strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me. “A\\n      warder, no doubt,” said he. “The moor has been thick with them\\n      since this fellow escaped.” Well, perhaps his explanation may be\\n      the right one, but I should like to have some further proof of\\n      it. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where\\n      they should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that\\n      we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our\\n      own prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you must\\n      acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in\\n      the matter of a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite\\n      irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let\\n      you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those\\n      which will be of most service to you in helping you to your\\n      conclusions. We are certainly making some progress. So far as the\\n      Barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions, and that\\n      has cleared up the situation very much. But the moor with its\\n      mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as\\n      ever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to throw some light upon\\n      this also. Best of all would it be if you could come down to us.\\n      In any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next\\n      few days.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10.\\n\\nExtract from the Diary of Dr. Watson\\n\\n      So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have\\n      forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now,\\n      however, I have arrived at a point in my narrative where I am\\n      compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my\\n      recollections, aided by the diary which I kept at the time. A few\\n      extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which\\n      are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I proceed,\\n      then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the\\n      convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.\\n\\n      _October_ 16_th_.—A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain.\\n      The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and\\n      then to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver\\n      veins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant boulders\\n      gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces. It is\\n      melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a black reaction\\n      after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself of a\\n      weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger—ever present\\n      danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define\\n      it.\\n\\n      And have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long\\n      sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister\\n      influence which is at work around us. There is the death of the\\n      last occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions\\n      of the family legend, and there are the repeated reports from\\n      peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor.\\n      Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the\\n      distant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impossible, that it\\n      should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature. A spectral\\n      hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its\\n      howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may fall in\\n      with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one\\n      quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade\\n      me to believe in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to\\n      the level of these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere\\n      fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting\\n      from his mouth and eyes. Holmes would not listen to such fancies,\\n      and I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice heard\\n      this crying upon the moor. Suppose that there were really some\\n      huge hound loose upon it; that would go far to explain\\n      everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did\\n      it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one\\n      saw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation\\n      offers almost as many difficulties as the other. And always,\\n      apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency in\\n      London, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry\\n      against the moor. This at least was real, but it might have been\\n      the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy. Where\\n      is that friend or enemy now? Has he remained in London, or has he\\n      followed us down here? Could he—could he be the stranger whom I\\n      saw upon the tor?\\n\\n      It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet\\n      there are some things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one\\n      whom I have seen down here, and I have now met all the\\n      neighbours. The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, far\\n      thinner than that of Frankland. Barrymore it might possibly have\\n      been, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that he\\n      could not have followed us. A stranger then is still dogging us,\\n      just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never shaken him\\n      off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we might\\n      find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one\\n      purpose I must now devote all my energies.\\n\\n      My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second\\n      and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as\\n      possible to anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have\\n      been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor. I will say\\n      nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps to\\n      attain my own end.\\n\\n      We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore\\n      asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in\\n      his study some little time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more\\n      than once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a pretty\\n      good idea what the point was which was under discussion. After a\\n      time the baronet opened his door and called for me. “Barrymore\\n      considers that he has a grievance,” he said. “He thinks that it\\n      was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he,\\n      of his own free will, had told us the secret.”\\n\\n      The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.\\n\\n      “I may have spoken too warmly, sir,” said he, “and if I have, I\\n      am sure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much\\n      surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning\\n      and learned that you had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has\\n      enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track.”\\n\\n      “If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a\\n      different thing,” said the baronet, “you only told us, or rather\\n      your wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could\\n      not help yourself.”\\n\\n      “I didn’t think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir\\n      Henry—indeed I didn’t.”\\n\\n      “The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered\\n      over the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You\\n      only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr.\\n      Stapleton’s house, for example, with no one but himself to defend\\n      it. There’s no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key.”\\n\\n      “He’ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon\\n      that. But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I\\n      assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary\\n      arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to\\n      South America. For God’s sake, sir, I beg of you not to let the\\n      police know that he is still on the moor. They have given up the\\n      chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for\\n      him. You can’t tell on him without getting my wife and me into\\n      trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.”\\n\\n      “What do you say, Watson?”\\n\\n      I shrugged my shoulders. “If he were safely out of the country it\\n      would relieve the tax-payer of a burden.”\\n\\n      “But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he\\n      goes?”\\n\\n      “He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with\\n      all that he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he\\n      was hiding.”\\n\\n      “That is true,” said Sir Henry. “Well, Barrymore—”\\n\\n      “God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have\\n      killed my poor wife had he been taken again.”\\n\\n      “I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after\\n      what we have heard I don’t feel as if I could give the man up, so\\n      there is an end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.”\\n\\n      With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he\\n      hesitated and then came back.\\n\\n      “You’ve been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the\\n      best I can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and\\n      perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the\\n      inquest that I found it out. I’ve never breathed a word about it\\n      yet to mortal man. It’s about poor Sir Charles’s death.”\\n\\n      The baronet and I were both upon our feet. “Do you know how he\\n      died?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, I don’t know that.”\\n\\n      “What then?”\\n\\n      “I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a\\n      woman.”\\n\\n      “To meet a woman! He?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “And the woman’s name?”\\n\\n      “I can’t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials.\\n      Her initials were L. L.”\\n\\n      “How do you know this, Barrymore?”\\n\\n      “Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had\\n      usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and well\\n      known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was\\n      glad to turn to him. But that morning, as it chanced, there was\\n      only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. It was\\n      from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman’s hand.”\\n\\n      “Well?”\\n\\n      “Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have\\n      done had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was\\n      cleaning out Sir Charles’s study—it had never been touched since\\n      his death—and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back\\n      of the grate. The greater part of it was charred to pieces, but\\n      one little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and the\\n      writing could still be read, though it was grey on a black\\n      ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the\\n      letter and it said: ‘Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn\\n      this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were\\n      signed the initials L. L.”\\n\\n      “Have you got that slip?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.”\\n\\n      “Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?”\\n\\n      “Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should\\n      not have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.”\\n\\n      “And you have no idea who L. L. is?”\\n\\n      “No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our\\n      hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles’s\\n      death.”\\n\\n      “I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this\\n      important information.”\\n\\n      “Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to\\n      us. And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir\\n      Charles, as we well might be considering all that he has done for\\n      us. To rake this up couldn’t help our poor master, and it’s well\\n      to go carefully when there’s a lady in the case. Even the best of\\n      us—”\\n\\n      “You thought it might injure his reputation?”\\n\\n      “Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have\\n      been kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you\\n      unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter.”\\n\\n      “Very good, Barrymore; you can go.” When the butler had left us\\n      Sir Henry turned to me. “Well, Watson, what do you think of this\\n      new light?”\\n\\n      “It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.”\\n\\n      “So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up\\n      the whole business. We have gained that much. We know that there\\n      is someone who has the facts if we can only find her. What do you\\n      think we should do?”\\n\\n      “Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue\\n      for which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not\\n      bring him down.”\\n\\n      I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning’s\\n      conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been\\n      very busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street\\n      were few and short, with no comments upon the information which I\\n      had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission. No doubt his\\n      blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties. And yet this\\n      new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his\\n      interest. I wish that he were here.\\n\\n      _October_ 17_th_.—All day today the rain poured down, rustling on\\n      the ivy and dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict out\\n      upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his\\n      crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them. And then I\\n      thought of that other one—the face in the cab, the figure against\\n      the moon. Was he also out in that deluged—the unseen watcher, the\\n      man of darkness? In the evening I put on my waterproof and I\\n      walked far upon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the\\n      rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears.\\n      God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the\\n      firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon\\n      which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit\\n      I looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls\\n      drifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured\\n      clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in grey wreaths down\\n      the sides of the fantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the\\n      left, half hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville\\n      Hall rose above the trees. They were the only signs of human life\\n      which I could see, save only those prehistoric huts which lay\\n      thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere was there any trace\\n      of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights\\n      before.\\n\\n      As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his\\n      dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying\\n      farmhouse of Foulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and\\n      hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see\\n      how we were getting on. He insisted upon my climbing into his\\n      dog-cart, and he gave me a lift homeward. I found him much\\n      troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel. It had\\n      wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I gave him such\\n      consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen\\n      Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.\\n\\n      “By the way, Mortimer,” said I as we jolted along the rough road,\\n      “I suppose there are few people living within driving distance of\\n      this whom you do not know?”\\n\\n      “Hardly any, I think.”\\n\\n      “Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are\\n      L. L.?”\\n\\n      He thought for a few minutes.\\n\\n      “No,” said he. “There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for\\n      whom I can’t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no\\n      one whose initials are those. Wait a bit though,” he added after\\n      a pause. “There is Laura Lyons—her initials are L. L.—but she\\n      lives in Coombe Tracey.”\\n\\n      “Who is she?” I asked.\\n\\n      “She is Frankland’s daughter.”\\n\\n      “What! Old Frankland the crank?”\\n\\n      “Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching\\n      on the moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The\\n      fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side.\\n      Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she\\n      had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other\\n      reasons as well. So, between the old sinner and the young one the\\n      girl has had a pretty bad time.”\\n\\n      “How does she live?”\\n\\n      “I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be\\n      more, for his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she\\n      may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the\\n      bad. Her story got about, and several of the people here did\\n      something to enable her to earn an honest living. Stapleton did\\n      for one, and Sir Charles for another. I gave a trifle myself. It\\n      was to set her up in a typewriting business.”\\n\\n      He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to\\n      satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is\\n      no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow\\n      morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see\\n      this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal reputation, a long step will\\n      have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of\\n      mysteries. I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent,\\n      for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent\\n      I asked him casually to what type Frankland’s skull belonged, and\\n      so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive. I have\\n      not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.\\n\\n      I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous\\n      and melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just\\n      now, which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due\\n      time.\\n\\n      Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played\\n      écarté afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the\\n      library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.\\n\\n      “Well,” said I, “has this precious relation of yours departed, or\\n      is he still lurking out yonder?”\\n\\n      “I don’t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has\\n      brought nothing but trouble here! I’ve not heard of him since I\\n      left out food for him last, and that was three days ago.”\\n\\n      “Did you see him then?”\\n\\n      “No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.”\\n\\n      “Then he was certainly there?”\\n\\n      “So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took\\n      it.”\\n\\n      I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at\\n      Barrymore.\\n\\n      “You know that there is another man then?”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.”\\n\\n      “Have you seen him?”\\n\\n      “No, sir.”\\n\\n      “How do you know of him then?”\\n\\n      “Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He’s in hiding,\\n      too, but he’s not a convict as far as I can make out. I don’t\\n      like it, Dr. Watson—I tell you straight, sir, that I don’t like\\n      it.” He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness.\\n\\n      “Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter\\n      but that of your master. I have come here with no object except\\n      to help him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don’t like.”\\n\\n      Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst\\n      or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words.\\n\\n      “It’s all these goings-on, sir,” he cried at last, waving his\\n      hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor.\\n      “There’s foul play somewhere, and there’s black villainy brewing,\\n      to that I’ll swear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry\\n      on his way back to London again!”\\n\\n      “But what is it that alarms you?”\\n\\n      “Look at Sir Charles’s death! That was bad enough, for all that\\n      the coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night.\\n      There’s not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for\\n      it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and\\n      waiting! What’s he waiting for? What does it mean? It means no\\n      good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall\\n      be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry’s new servants\\n      are ready to take over the Hall.”\\n\\n      “But about this stranger,” said I. “Can you tell me anything\\n      about him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or\\n      what he was doing?”\\n\\n      “He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing\\n      away. At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he\\n      found that he had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he\\n      was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing he could not\\n      make out.”\\n\\n      “And where did he say that he lived?”\\n\\n      “Among the old houses on the hillside—the stone huts where the\\n      old folk used to live.”\\n\\n      “But how about his food?”\\n\\n      “Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and\\n      brings all he needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what\\n      he wants.”\\n\\n      “Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other\\n      time.” When the butler had gone I walked over to the black\\n      window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds\\n      and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. It is a wild\\n      night indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor.\\n      What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in\\n      such a place at such a time! And what deep and earnest purpose\\n      can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that hut upon\\n      the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has\\n      vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have\\n      passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart\\n      of the mystery.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11.\\n\\nThe Man on the Tor\\n\\n      The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter\\n      has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time\\n      when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their\\n      terrible conclusion. The incidents of the next few days are\\n      indelibly graven upon my recollection, and I can tell them\\n      without reference to the notes made at the time. I start them\\n      from the day which succeeded that upon which I had established\\n      two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of\\n      Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an\\n      appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his\\n      death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be\\n      found among the stone huts upon the hillside. With these two\\n      facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my\\n      courage must be deficient if I could not throw some further light\\n      upon these dark places.\\n\\n      I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about\\n      Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained\\n      with him at cards until it was very late. At breakfast, however,\\n      I informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would\\n      care to accompany me to Coombe Tracey. At first he was very eager\\n      to come, but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I\\n      went alone the results might be better. The more formal we made\\n      the visit the less information we might obtain. I left Sir Henry\\n      behind, therefore, not without some prickings of conscience, and\\n      drove off upon my new quest.\\n\\n      When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses,\\n      and I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate.\\n      I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and\\n      well appointed. A maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I\\n      entered the sitting-room a lady, who was sitting before a\\n      Remington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome.\\n      Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger, and\\n      she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.\\n\\n      The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme\\n      beauty. Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and\\n      her cheeks, though considerably freckled, were flushed with the\\n      exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at\\n      the heart of the sulphur rose. Admiration was, I repeat, the\\n      first impression. But the second was criticism. There was\\n      something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of\\n      expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip\\n      which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are\\n      afterthoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in\\n      the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me\\n      the reasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that\\n      instant how delicate my mission was.\\n\\n      “I have the pleasure,” said I, “of knowing your father.”\\n\\n      It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it.\\n      “There is nothing in common between my father and me,” she said.\\n      “I owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not\\n      for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I\\n      might have starved for all that my father cared.”\\n\\n      “It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come\\n      here to see you.”\\n\\n      The freckles started out on the lady’s face.\\n\\n      “What can I tell you about him?” she asked, and her fingers\\n      played nervously over the stops of her typewriter.\\n\\n      “You knew him, did you not?”\\n\\n      “I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If\\n      I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest\\n      which he took in my unhappy situation.”\\n\\n      “Did you correspond with him?”\\n\\n      The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.\\n\\n      “What is the object of these questions?” she asked sharply.\\n\\n      “The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I\\n      should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our\\n      control.”\\n\\n      She was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she\\n      looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner.\\n\\n      “Well, I’ll answer,” she said. “What are your questions?”\\n\\n      “Did you correspond with Sir Charles?”\\n\\n      “I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his\\n      delicacy and his generosity.”\\n\\n      “Have you the dates of those letters?”\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “Have you ever met him?”\\n\\n      “Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a\\n      very retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.”\\n\\n      “But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he\\n      know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say\\n      that he has done?”\\n\\n      She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.\\n\\n      “There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united\\n      to help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate\\n      friend of Sir Charles’s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was\\n      through him that Sir Charles learned about my affairs.”\\n\\n      I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton\\n      his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady’s statement bore\\n      the impress of truth upon it.\\n\\n      “Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?” I\\n      continued.\\n\\n      Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. “Really, sir, this is a very\\n      extraordinary question.”\\n\\n      “I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.”\\n\\n      “Then I answer, certainly not.”\\n\\n      “Not on the very day of Sir Charles’s death?”\\n\\n      The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before\\n      me. Her dry lips could not speak the “No” which I saw rather than\\n      heard.\\n\\n      “Surely your memory deceives you,” said I. “I could even quote a\\n      passage of your letter. It ran ‘Please, please, as you are a\\n      gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o’clock.’”\\n\\n      I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a\\n      supreme effort.\\n\\n      “Is there no such thing as a gentleman?” she gasped.\\n\\n      “You do Sir Charles an injustice. He _did_ burn the letter. But\\n      sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned. You\\n      acknowledge now that you wrote it?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I did write it,” she cried, pouring out her soul in a\\n      torrent of words. “I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have\\n      no reason to be ashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I\\n      believed that if I had an interview I could gain his help, so I\\n      asked him to meet me.”\\n\\n      “But why at such an hour?”\\n\\n      “Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next\\n      day and might be away for months. There were reasons why I could\\n      not get there earlier.”\\n\\n      “But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the\\n      house?”\\n\\n      “Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor’s\\n      house?”\\n\\n      “Well, what happened when you did get there?”\\n\\n      “I never went.”\\n\\n      “Mrs. Lyons!”\\n\\n      “No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went.\\n      Something intervened to prevent my going.”\\n\\n      “What was that?”\\n\\n      “That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.”\\n\\n      “You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir\\n      Charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death, but\\n      you deny that you kept the appointment.”\\n\\n      “That is the truth.”\\n\\n      Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get\\n      past that point.\\n\\n      “Mrs. Lyons,” said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive\\n      interview, “you are taking a very great responsibility and\\n      putting yourself in a very false position by not making an\\n      absolutely clean breast of all that you know. If I have to call\\n      in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are\\n      compromised. If your position is innocent, why did you in the\\n      first instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that\\n      date?”\\n\\n      “Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from\\n      it and that I might find myself involved in a scandal.”\\n\\n      “And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy\\n      your letter?”\\n\\n      “If you have read the letter you will know.”\\n\\n      “I did not say that I had read all the letter.”\\n\\n      “You quoted some of it.”\\n\\n      “I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned\\n      and it was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that\\n      you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter\\n      which he received on the day of his death.”\\n\\n      “The matter is a very private one.”\\n\\n      “The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.”\\n\\n      “I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy\\n      history you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason\\n      to regret it.”\\n\\n      “I have heard so much.”\\n\\n      “My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I\\n      abhor. The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the\\n      possibility that he may force me to live with him. At the time\\n      that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there\\n      was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses\\n      could be met. It meant everything to me—peace of mind, happiness,\\n      self-respect—everything. I knew Sir Charles’s generosity, and I\\n      thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help\\n      me.”\\n\\n      “Then how is it that you did not go?”\\n\\n      “Because I received help in the interval from another source.”\\n\\n      “Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?”\\n\\n      “So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next\\n      morning.”\\n\\n      The woman’s story hung coherently together, and all my questions\\n      were unable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she\\n      had, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against her husband\\n      at or about the time of the tragedy.\\n\\n      It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been\\n      to Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be\\n      necessary to take her there, and could not have returned to\\n      Coombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning. Such an\\n      excursion could not be kept secret. The probability was,\\n      therefore, that she was telling the truth, or, at least, a part\\n      of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened. Once again I\\n      had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every\\n      path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet\\n      the more I thought of the lady’s face and of her manner the more\\n      I felt that something was being held back from me. Why should she\\n      turn so pale? Why should she fight against every admission until\\n      it was forced from her? Why should she have been so reticent at\\n      the time of the tragedy? Surely the explanation of all this could\\n      not be as innocent as she would have me believe. For the moment I\\n      could proceed no farther in that direction, but must turn back to\\n      that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts\\n      upon the moor.\\n\\n      And that was a most vague direction. I realised it as I drove\\n      back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient\\n      people. Barrymore’s only indication had been that the stranger\\n      lived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them\\n      are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor. But\\n      I had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man\\n      himself standing upon the summit of the Black Tor. That, then,\\n      should be the centre of my search. From there I should explore\\n      every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right one. If\\n      this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at\\n      the point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had\\n      dogged us so long. He might slip away from us in the crowd of\\n      Regent Street, but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely\\n      moor. On the other hand, if I should find the hut and its tenant\\n      should not be within it I must remain there, however long the\\n      vigil, until he returned. Holmes had missed him in London. It\\n      would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run him to earth\\n      where my master had failed.\\n\\n      Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now\\n      at last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was\\n      none other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, grey-whiskered\\n      and red-faced, outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to\\n      the highroad along which I travelled.\\n\\n      “Good-day, Dr. Watson,” cried he with unwonted good humour, “you\\n      must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass\\n      of wine and to congratulate me.”\\n\\n      My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after\\n      what I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was\\n      anxious to send Perkins and the wagonette home, and the\\n      opportunity was a good one. I alighted and sent a message to Sir\\n      Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner. Then I followed\\n      Frankland into his dining-room.\\n\\n      “It is a great day for me, sir—one of the red-letter days of my\\n      life,” he cried with many chuckles. “I have brought off a double\\n      event. I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and\\n      that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it. I have\\n      established a right of way through the centre of old Middleton’s\\n      park, slap across it, sir, within a hundred yards of his own\\n      front door. What do you think of that? We’ll teach these magnates\\n      that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners,\\n      confound them! And I’ve closed the wood where the Fernworthy folk\\n      used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that there\\n      are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they\\n      like with their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr.\\n      Watson, and both in my favour. I haven’t had such a day since I\\n      had Sir John Morland for trespass because he shot in his own\\n      warren.”\\n\\n      “How on earth did you do that?”\\n\\n      “Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading—Frankland\\n      _v_. Morland, Court of Queen’s Bench. It cost me £200, but I got\\n      my verdict.”\\n\\n      “Did it do you any good?”\\n\\n      “None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the\\n      matter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no\\n      doubt, for example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in\\n      effigy tonight. I told the police last time they did it that they\\n      should stop these disgraceful exhibitions. The County\\n      Constabulary is in a scandalous state, sir, and it has not\\n      afforded me the protection to which I am entitled. The case of\\n      Frankland _v_. Regina will bring the matter before the attention\\n      of the public. I told them that they would have occasion to\\n      regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come\\n      true.”\\n\\n      “How so?” I asked.\\n\\n      The old man put on a very knowing expression. “Because I could\\n      tell them what they are dying to know; but nothing would induce\\n      me to help the rascals in any way.”\\n\\n      I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get\\n      away from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it.\\n      I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to\\n      understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest\\n      way to stop his confidences.\\n\\n      “Some poaching case, no doubt?” said I with an indifferent\\n      manner.\\n\\n      “Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that!\\n      What about the convict on the moor?”\\n\\n      I stared. “You don’t mean that you know where he is?” said I.\\n\\n      “I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I\\n      could help the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never\\n      struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where\\n      he got his food and so trace it to him?”\\n\\n      He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth.\\n      “No doubt,” said I; “but how do you know that he is anywhere upon\\n      the moor?”\\n\\n      “I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who\\n      takes him his food.”\\n\\n      My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the\\n      power of this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a\\n      weight from my mind.\\n\\n      “You’ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a\\n      child. I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He\\n      passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should\\n      he be going except to the convict?”\\n\\n      Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of\\n      interest. A child! Barrymore had said that our unknown was\\n      supplied by a boy. It was on his track, and not upon the\\n      convict’s, that Frankland had stumbled. If I could get his\\n      knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But incredulity\\n      and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.\\n\\n      “I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of\\n      one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father’s dinner.”\\n\\n      The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old\\n      autocrat. His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his grey\\n      whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat.\\n\\n      “Indeed, sir!” said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching\\n      moor. “Do you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see\\n      the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it? It is the\\n      stoniest part of the whole moor. Is that a place where a shepherd\\n      would be likely to take his station? Your suggestion, sir, is a\\n      most absurd one.”\\n\\n      I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the\\n      facts. My submission pleased him and led him to further\\n      confidences.\\n\\n      “You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I\\n      come to an opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his\\n      bundle. Every day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been\\n      able—but wait a moment, Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is\\n      there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside?”\\n\\n      It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark\\n      dot against the dull green and grey.\\n\\n      “Come, sir, come!” cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. “You will\\n      see with your own eyes and judge for yourself.”\\n\\n      The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod,\\n      stood upon the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye\\n      to it and gave a cry of satisfaction.\\n\\n      “Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!”\\n\\n      There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle\\n      upon his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached\\n      the crest I saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant\\n      against the cold blue sky. He looked round him with a furtive and\\n      stealthy air, as one who dreads pursuit. Then he vanished over\\n      the hill.\\n\\n      “Well! Am I right?”\\n\\n      “Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.”\\n\\n      “And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But\\n      not one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy\\n      also, Dr. Watson. Not a word! You understand!”\\n\\n      “Just as you wish.”\\n\\n      “They have treated me shamefully—shamefully. When the facts come\\n      out in Frankland _v_. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of\\n      indignation will run through the country. Nothing would induce me\\n      to help the police in any way. For all they cared it might have\\n      been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at the\\n      stake. Surely you are not going! You will help me to empty the\\n      decanter in honour of this great occasion!”\\n\\n      But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading\\n      him from his announced intention of walking home with me. I kept\\n      the road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off\\n      across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy\\n      had disappeared. Everything was working in my favour, and I swore\\n      that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that\\n      I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way.\\n\\n      The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the\\n      hill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one\\n      side and grey shadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the\\n      farthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of\\n      Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide expanse there was no sound\\n      and no movement. One great grey bird, a gull or curlew, soared\\n      aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the only living\\n      things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath\\n      it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery\\n      and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy\\n      was nowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of the\\n      hills there was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle\\n      of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a\\n      screen against the weather. My heart leaped within me as I saw\\n      it. This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked. At last my\\n      foot was on the threshold of his hiding place—his secret was\\n      within my grasp.\\n\\n      As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do\\n      when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I\\n      satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a\\n      habitation. A vague pathway among the boulders led to the\\n      dilapidated opening which served as a door. All was silent\\n      within. The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be\\n      prowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of\\n      adventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the\\n      butt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked\\n      in. The place was empty.\\n\\n      But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false\\n      scent. This was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets\\n      rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which\\n      Neolithic man had once slumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped\\n      in a rude grate. Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket\\n      half-full of water. A litter of empty tins showed that the place\\n      had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes became\\n      accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-full\\n      bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of the\\n      hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this\\n      stood a small cloth bundle—the same, no doubt, which I had seen\\n      through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained\\n      a loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved\\n      peaches. As I set it down again, after having examined it, my\\n      heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper\\n      with writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I read,\\n      roughly scrawled in pencil: “Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe\\n      Tracey.”\\n\\n      For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking\\n      out the meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir\\n      Henry, who was being dogged by this secret man. He had not\\n      followed me himself, but he had set an agent—the boy,\\n      perhaps—upon my track, and this was his report. Possibly I had\\n      taken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not been\\n      observed and reported. Always there was this feeling of an unseen\\n      force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and\\n      delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme\\n      moment that one realised that one was indeed entangled in its\\n      meshes.\\n\\n      If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round\\n      the hut in search of them. There was no trace, however, of\\n      anything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which might\\n      indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this\\n      singular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits and cared\\n      little for the comforts of life. When I thought of the heavy\\n      rains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and\\n      immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that\\n      inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by\\n      chance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut\\n      until I knew.\\n\\n      Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with\\n      scarlet and gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches\\n      by the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There\\n      were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur\\n      of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen. Between the two,\\n      behind the hill, was the house of the Stapletons. All was sweet\\n      and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as I\\n      looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature but\\n      quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which\\n      every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves but a\\n      fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited\\n      with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.\\n\\n      And then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a\\n      boot striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming\\n      nearer and nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and\\n      cocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover myself\\n      until I had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger.\\n      There was a long pause which showed that he had stopped. Then\\n      once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the\\n      opening of the hut.\\n\\n      “It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,” said a well-known\\n      voice. “I really think that you will be more comfortable outside\\n      than in.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12.\\n\\nDeath on the Moor\\n\\n      For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my\\n      ears. Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a\\n      crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be\\n      lifted from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice could\\n      belong to but one man in all the world.\\n\\n      “Holmes!” I cried—“Holmes!”\\n\\n      “Come out,” said he, “and please be careful with the revolver.”\\n\\n      I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone\\n      outside, his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon\\n      my astonished features. He was thin and worn, but clear and\\n      alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the\\n      wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other\\n      tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that catlike\\n      love of personal cleanliness which was one of his\\n      characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen\\n      as perfect as if he were in Baker Street.\\n\\n      “I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,” said I as I\\n      wrung him by the hand.\\n\\n      “Or more astonished, eh?”\\n\\n      “Well, I must confess to it.”\\n\\n      “The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no\\n      idea that you had found my occasional retreat, still less that\\n      you were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door.”\\n\\n      “My footprint, I presume?”\\n\\n      “No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your\\n      footprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously\\n      desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I\\n      see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know\\n      that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it\\n      there beside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at that\\n      supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut.”\\n\\n      “Exactly.”\\n\\n      “I thought as much—and knowing your admirable tenacity I was\\n      convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach,\\n      waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that I\\n      was the criminal?”\\n\\n      “I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.”\\n\\n      “Excellent, Watson! And how did you localise me? You saw me,\\n      perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so\\n      imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I saw you then.”\\n\\n      “And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this\\n      one?”\\n\\n      “No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where\\n      to look.”\\n\\n      “The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make\\n      it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.” He\\n      rose and peeped into the hut. “Ha, I see that Cartwright has\\n      brought up some supplies. What’s this paper? So you have been to\\n      Coombe Tracey, have you?”\\n\\n      “Yes.”\\n\\n      “To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?”\\n\\n      “Exactly.”\\n\\n      “Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on\\n      parallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall\\n      have a fairly full knowledge of the case.”\\n\\n      “Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the\\n      responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my\\n      nerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what\\n      have you been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street\\n      working out that case of blackmailing.”\\n\\n      “That was what I wished you to think.”\\n\\n      “Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!” I cried with some\\n      bitterness. “I think that I have deserved better at your hands,\\n      Holmes.”\\n\\n      “My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in\\n      many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have\\n      seemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your\\n      own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger\\n      which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter\\n      for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident\\n      that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my\\n      presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on\\n      their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I could\\n      not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I\\n      remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all\\n      my weight at a critical moment.”\\n\\n      “But why keep me in the dark?”\\n\\n      “For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have\\n      led to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something,\\n      or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or\\n      other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run. I brought\\n      Cartwright down with me—you remember the little chap at the\\n      express office—and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of\\n      bread and a clean collar. What does man want more? He has given\\n      me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet, and\\n      both have been invaluable.”\\n\\n      “Then my reports have all been wasted!”—My voice trembled as I\\n      recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.\\n\\n      Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.\\n\\n      “Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I\\n      assure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only\\n      delayed one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly\\n      upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an\\n      extraordinarily difficult case.”\\n\\n      I was still rather raw over the deception which had been\\n      practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes’s praise drove my\\n      anger from my mind. I felt also in my heart that he was right in\\n      what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I\\n      should not have known that he was upon the moor.\\n\\n      “That’s better,” said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face.\\n      “And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons—it\\n      was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you\\n      had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person in\\n      Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter. In\\n      fact, if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that I\\n      should have gone tomorrow.”\\n\\n      The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had\\n      turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There,\\n      sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my\\n      conversation with the lady. So interested was he that I had to\\n      repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied.\\n\\n      “This is most important,” said he when I had concluded. “It fills\\n      up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex\\n      affair. You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists\\n      between this lady and the man Stapleton?”\\n\\n      “I did not know of a close intimacy.”\\n\\n      “There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write,\\n      there is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a\\n      very powerful weapon into our hands. If I could only use it to\\n      detach his wife—”\\n\\n      “His wife?”\\n\\n      “I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you\\n      have given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is\\n      in reality his wife.”\\n\\n      “Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he\\n      have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?”\\n\\n      “Sir Henry’s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except\\n      Sir Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make\\n      love to her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the\\n      lady is his wife and not his sister.”\\n\\n      “But why this elaborate deception?”\\n\\n      “Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to\\n      him in the character of a free woman.”\\n\\n      All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took\\n      shape and centred upon the naturalist. In that impassive\\n      colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I\\n      seemed to see something terrible—a creature of infinite patience\\n      and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart.\\n\\n      “It is he, then, who is our enemy—it is he who dogged us in\\n      London?”\\n\\n      “So I read the riddle.”\\n\\n      “And the warning—it must have come from her!”\\n\\n      “Exactly.”\\n\\n      The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed,\\n      loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long.\\n\\n      “But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman\\n      is his wife?”\\n\\n      “Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of\\n      autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare\\n      say he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a\\n      schoolmaster in the north of England. Now, there is no one more\\n      easy to trace than a schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies\\n      by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession.\\n      A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief\\n      under atrocious circumstances, and that the man who had owned\\n      it—the name was different—had disappeared with his wife. The\\n      descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man was\\n      devoted to entomology the identification was complete.”\\n\\n      The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the\\n      shadows.\\n\\n      “If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons\\n      come in?” I asked.\\n\\n      “That is one of the points upon which your own researches have\\n      shed a light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the\\n      situation very much. I did not know about a projected divorce\\n      between herself and her husband. In that case, regarding\\n      Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming\\n      his wife.”\\n\\n      “And when she is undeceived?”\\n\\n      “Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first\\n      duty to see her—both of us—tomorrow. Don’t you think, Watson,\\n      that you are away from your charge rather long? Your place should\\n      be at Baskerville Hall.”\\n\\n      The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had\\n      settled upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a\\n      violet sky.\\n\\n      “One last question, Holmes,” I said as I rose. “Surely there is\\n      no need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it\\n      all? What is he after?”\\n\\n      Holmes’s voice sank as he answered:\\n\\n      “It is murder, Watson—refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder.\\n      Do not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even\\n      as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already\\n      almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten\\n      us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so.\\n      Another day—two at the most—and I have my case complete, but\\n      until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother\\n      watched her ailing child. Your mission today has justified\\n      itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his\\n      side. Hark!”\\n\\n      A terrible scream—a prolonged yell of horror and anguish—burst\\n      out of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the\\n      blood to ice in my veins.\\n\\n      “Oh, my God!” I gasped. “What is it? What does it mean?”\\n\\n      Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic\\n      outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head\\n      thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.\\n\\n      “Hush!” he whispered. “Hush!”\\n\\n      The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had\\n      pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it\\n      burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.\\n\\n      “Where is it?” Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of\\n      his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.\\n      “Where is it, Watson?”\\n\\n      “There, I think.” I pointed into the darkness.\\n\\n      “No, there!”\\n\\n      Again the agonised cry swept through the silent night, louder and\\n      much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep,\\n      muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling\\n      like the low, constant murmur of the sea.\\n\\n      “The hound!” cried Holmes. “Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if\\n      we are too late!”\\n\\n      He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed\\n      at his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground\\n      immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell,\\n      and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not another\\n      sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.\\n\\n      I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted.\\n      He stamped his feet upon the ground.\\n\\n      “He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.”\\n\\n      “No, no, surely not!”\\n\\n      “Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes\\n      of abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has\\n      happened we’ll avenge him!”\\n\\n      Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders,\\n      forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and\\n      rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those\\n      dreadful sounds had come. At every rise Holmes looked eagerly\\n      round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing\\n      moved upon its dreary face.\\n\\n      “Can you see anything?”\\n\\n      “Nothing.”\\n\\n      “But, hark, what is that?”\\n\\n      A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our\\n      left! On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which\\n      overlooked a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was\\n      spread-eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran towards it\\n      the vague outline hardened into a definite shape. It was a\\n      prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled\\n      under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body\\n      hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. So\\n      grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant\\n      realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a\\n      whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which\\n      we stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again\\n      with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which he\\n      struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool\\n      which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. And it\\n      shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint\\n      within us—the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!\\n\\n      There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar\\n      ruddy tweed suit—the very one which he had worn on the first\\n      morning that we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one\\n      clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out,\\n      even as the hope had gone out of our souls. Holmes groaned, and\\n      his face glimmered white through the darkness.\\n\\n      “The brute! The brute!” I cried with clenched hands. “Oh Holmes,\\n      I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.”\\n\\n      “I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case\\n      well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my\\n      client. It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my\\n      career. But how could I know—how _could_ I know—that he would\\n      risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my\\n      warnings?”\\n\\n      “That we should have heard his screams—my God, those screams!—and\\n      yet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound\\n      which drove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks\\n      at this instant. And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for\\n      this deed.”\\n\\n      “He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been\\n      murdered—the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast\\n      which he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his end\\n      in his wild flight to escape from it. But now we have to prove\\n      the connection between the man and the beast. Save from what we\\n      heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, since\\n      Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. But, by heavens,\\n      cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before another\\n      day is past!”\\n\\n      We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,\\n      overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had\\n      brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then\\n      as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which\\n      our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over\\n      the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away, miles\\n      off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light\\n      was shining. It could only come from the lonely abode of the\\n      Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed.\\n\\n      “Why should we not seize him at once?”\\n\\n      “Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the\\n      last degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we\\n      make one false move the villain may escape us yet.”\\n\\n      “What can we do?”\\n\\n      “There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only\\n      perform the last offices to our poor friend.”\\n\\n      Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and\\n      approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones.\\n      The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain\\n      and blurred my eyes with tears.\\n\\n      “We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way\\n      to the Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?”\\n\\n      He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing\\n      and laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern,\\n      self-contained friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!\\n\\n      “A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!”\\n\\n      “A beard?”\\n\\n      “It is not the baronet—it is—why, it is my neighbour, the\\n      convict!”\\n\\n      With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that\\n      dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There\\n      could be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal\\n      eyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the\\n      light of the candle from over the rock—the face of Selden, the\\n      criminal.\\n\\n      Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the\\n      baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to\\n      Barrymore. Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden in\\n      his escape. Boots, shirt, cap—it was all Sir Henry’s. The tragedy\\n      was still black enough, but this man had at least deserved death\\n      by the laws of his country. I told Holmes how the matter stood,\\n      my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.\\n\\n      “Then the clothes have been the poor devil’s death,” said he. “It\\n      is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article\\n      of Sir Henry’s—the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all\\n      probability—and so ran this man down. There is one very singular\\n      thing, however: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that\\n      the hound was on his trail?”\\n\\n      “He heard him.”\\n\\n      “To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like\\n      this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk\\n      recapture by screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have\\n      run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track. How did\\n      he know?”\\n\\n      “A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all\\n      our conjectures are correct—”\\n\\n      “I presume nothing.”\\n\\n      “Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose\\n      that it does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would\\n      not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would\\n      be there.”\\n\\n      “My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think\\n      that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while\\n      mine may remain forever a mystery. The question now is, what\\n      shall we do with this poor wretch’s body? We cannot leave it here\\n      to the foxes and the ravens.”\\n\\n      “I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can\\n      communicate with the police.”\\n\\n      “Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far.\\n      Halloa, Watson, what’s this? It’s the man himself, by all that’s\\n      wonderful and audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions—not a\\n      word, or my plans crumble to the ground.”\\n\\n      A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red\\n      glow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish\\n      the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped\\n      when he saw us, and then came on again.\\n\\n      “Why, Dr. Watson, that’s not you, is it? You are the last man\\n      that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time\\n      of night. But, dear me, what’s this? Somebody hurt? Not—don’t\\n      tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!” He hurried past me and\\n      stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath\\n      and the cigar fell from his fingers.\\n\\n      “Who—who’s this?” he stammered.\\n\\n      “It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.”\\n\\n      Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort\\n      he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked\\n      sharply from Holmes to me. “Dear me! What a very shocking affair!\\n      How did he die?”\\n\\n      “He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks.\\n      My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.”\\n\\n      “I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy\\n      about Sir Henry.”\\n\\n      “Why about Sir Henry in particular?” I could not help asking.\\n\\n      “Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did\\n      not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his\\n      safety when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way”—his eyes\\n      darted again from my face to Holmes’s—“did you hear anything else\\n      besides a cry?”\\n\\n      “No,” said Holmes; “did you?”\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “What do you mean, then?”\\n\\n      “Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom\\n      hound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor.\\n      I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound\\n      tonight.”\\n\\n      “We heard nothing of the kind,” said I.\\n\\n      “And what is your theory of this poor fellow’s death?”\\n\\n      “I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off\\n      his head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and\\n      eventually fallen over here and broken his neck.”\\n\\n      “That seems the most reasonable theory,” said Stapleton, and he\\n      gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. “What do you\\n      think about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”\\n\\n      My friend bowed his compliments. “You are quick at\\n      identification,” said he.\\n\\n      “We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came\\n      down. You are in time to see a tragedy.”\\n\\n      “Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend’s explanation will\\n      cover the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to\\n      London with me tomorrow.”\\n\\n      “Oh, you return tomorrow?”\\n\\n      “That is my intention.”\\n\\n      “I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences\\n      which have puzzled us?”\\n\\n      Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n      “One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An\\n      investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not\\n      been a satisfactory case.”\\n\\n      My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner.\\n      Stapleton still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.\\n\\n      “I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it\\n      would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified\\n      in doing it. I think that if we put something over his face he\\n      will be safe until morning.”\\n\\n      And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton’s offer of\\n      hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving\\n      the naturalist to return alone. Looking back we saw the figure\\n      moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one\\n      black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was\\n      lying who had come so horribly to his end.\\n\\n      “We’re at close grips at last,” said Holmes as we walked together\\n      across the moor. “What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled\\n      himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing\\n      shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his\\n      plot. I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again,\\n      that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.”\\n\\n      “I am sorry that he has seen you.”\\n\\n      “And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.”\\n\\n      “What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he\\n      knows you are here?”\\n\\n      “It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to\\n      desperate measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be\\n      too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has\\n      completely deceived us.”\\n\\n      “Why should we not arrest him at once?”\\n\\n      “My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your\\n      instinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for\\n      argument’s sake, that we had him arrested tonight, what on earth\\n      the better off should we be for that? We could prove nothing\\n      against him. There’s the devilish cunning of it! If he were\\n      acting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but if\\n      we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not\\n      help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.”\\n\\n      “Surely we have a case.”\\n\\n      “Not a shadow of one—only surmise and conjecture. We should be\\n      laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such\\n      evidence.”\\n\\n      “There is Sir Charles’s death.”\\n\\n      “Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died\\n      of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how\\n      are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are\\n      there of a hound? Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course we\\n      know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles\\n      was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we have to prove\\n      all this, and we are not in a position to do it.”\\n\\n      “Well, then, tonight?”\\n\\n      “We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct\\n      connection between the hound and the man’s death. We never saw\\n      the hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was\\n      running upon this man’s trail. There is a complete absence of\\n      motive. No, my dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves to the\\n      fact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth our\\n      while to run any risk in order to establish one.”\\n\\n      “And how do you propose to do so?”\\n\\n      “I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when\\n      the position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own\\n      plan as well. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I\\n      hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last.”\\n\\n      I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in\\n      thought, as far as the Baskerville gates.\\n\\n      “Are you coming up?”\\n\\n      “Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,\\n      Watson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that\\n      Selden’s death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will\\n      have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo\\n      tomorrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright,\\n      to dine with these people.”\\n\\n      “And so am I.”\\n\\n      “Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be\\n      easily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think\\n      that we are both ready for our suppers.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13.\\n\\nFixing the Nets\\n\\n      Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes,\\n      for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would\\n      bring him down from London. He did raise his eyebrows, however,\\n      when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any\\n      explanations for its absence. Between us we soon supplied his\\n      wants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet\\n      as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should\\n      know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to\\n      Barrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an unmitigated\\n      relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world he\\n      was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her\\n      he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the\\n      child who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has\\n      not one woman to mourn him.\\n\\n      “I’ve been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in\\n      the morning,” said the baronet. “I guess I should have some\\n      credit, for I have kept my promise. If I hadn’t sworn not to go\\n      about alone I might have had a more lively evening, for I had a\\n      message from Stapleton asking me over there.”\\n\\n      “I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,”\\n      said Holmes drily. “By the way, I don’t suppose you appreciate\\n      that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck?”\\n\\n      Sir Henry opened his eyes. “How was that?”\\n\\n      “This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your\\n      servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the\\n      police.”\\n\\n      “That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I\\n      know.”\\n\\n      “That’s lucky for him—in fact, it’s lucky for all of you, since\\n      you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not\\n      sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to\\n      arrest the whole household. Watson’s reports are most\\n      incriminating documents.”\\n\\n      “But how about the case?” asked the baronet. “Have you made\\n      anything out of the tangle? I don’t know that Watson and I are\\n      much the wiser since we came down.”\\n\\n      “I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation\\n      rather more clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly\\n      difficult and most complicated business. There are several points\\n      upon which we still want light—but it is coming all the same.”\\n\\n      “We’ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We\\n      heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all\\n      empty superstition. I had something to do with dogs when I was\\n      out West, and I know one when I hear one. If you can muzzle that\\n      one and put him on a chain I’ll be ready to swear you are the\\n      greatest detective of all time.”\\n\\n      “I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will\\n      give me your help.”\\n\\n      “Whatever you tell me to do I will do.”\\n\\n      “Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without\\n      always asking the reason.”\\n\\n      “Just as you like.”\\n\\n      “If you will do this I think the chances are that our little\\n      problem will soon be solved. I have no doubt—”\\n\\n      He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the\\n      air. The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so\\n      still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical\\n      statue, a personification of alertness and expectation.\\n\\n      “What is it?” we both cried.\\n\\n      I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some\\n      internal emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes\\n      shone with amused exultation.\\n\\n      “Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,” said he as he waved his\\n      hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite\\n      wall. “Watson won’t allow that I know anything of art but that is\\n      mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ. Now,\\n      these are a really very fine series of portraits.”\\n\\n      “Well, I’m glad to hear you say so,” said Sir Henry, glancing\\n      with some surprise at my friend. “I don’t pretend to know much\\n      about these things, and I’d be a better judge of a horse or a\\n      steer than of a picture. I didn’t know that you found time for\\n      such things.”\\n\\n      “I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That’s a\\n      Kneller, I’ll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and\\n      the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are\\n      all family portraits, I presume?”\\n\\n      “Every one.”\\n\\n      “Do you know the names?”\\n\\n      “Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my\\n      lessons fairly well.”\\n\\n      “Who is the gentleman with the telescope?”\\n\\n      “That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the\\n      West Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is\\n      Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the\\n      House of Commons under Pitt.”\\n\\n      “And this Cavalier opposite to me—the one with the black velvet\\n      and the lace?”\\n\\n      “Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all\\n      the mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the\\n      Baskervilles. We’re not likely to forget him.”\\n\\n      I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.\\n\\n      “Dear me!” said Holmes, “he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man\\n      enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his\\n      eyes. I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.”\\n\\n      “There’s no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the\\n      date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas.”\\n\\n      Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer\\n      seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were\\n      continually fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later,\\n      when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow\\n      the trend of his thoughts. He led me back into the\\n      banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it\\n      up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.\\n\\n      “Do you see anything there?”\\n\\n      I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the\\n      white lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed\\n      between them. It was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim,\\n      hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly\\n      intolerant eye.\\n\\n      “Is it like anyone you know?”\\n\\n      “There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.”\\n\\n      “Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!” He stood upon\\n      a chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved\\n      his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.\\n\\n      “Good heavens!” I cried in amazement.\\n\\n      The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.\\n\\n      “Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces\\n      and not their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal\\n      investigator that he should see through a disguise.”\\n\\n      “But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.”\\n\\n      “Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears\\n      to be both physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is\\n      enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The\\n      fellow is a Baskerville—that is evident.”\\n\\n      “With designs upon the succession.”\\n\\n      “Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of\\n      our most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him,\\n      and I dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering\\n      in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a\\n      cork, and a card, and we add him to the Baker Street collection!”\\n      He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away\\n      from the picture. I have not heard him laugh often, and it has\\n      always boded ill to somebody.\\n\\n      I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier\\n      still, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.\\n\\n      “Yes, we should have a full day today,” he remarked, and he\\n      rubbed his hands with the joy of action. “The nets are all in\\n      place, and the drag is about to begin. We’ll know before the day\\n      is out whether we have caught our big, lean-jawed pike, or\\n      whether he has got through the meshes.”\\n\\n      “Have you been on the moor already?”\\n\\n      “I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death\\n      of Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be\\n      troubled in the matter. And I have also communicated with my\\n      faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the\\n      door of my hut, as a dog does at his master’s grave, if I had not\\n      set his mind at rest about my safety.”\\n\\n      “What is the next move?”\\n\\n      “To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!”\\n\\n      “Good-morning, Holmes,” said the baronet. “You look like a\\n      general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.”\\n\\n      “That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.”\\n\\n      “And so do I.”\\n\\n      “Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our\\n      friends the Stapletons tonight.”\\n\\n      “I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people,\\n      and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you.”\\n\\n      “I fear that Watson and I must go to London.”\\n\\n      “To London?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present\\n      juncture.”\\n\\n      The baronet’s face perceptibly lengthened.\\n\\n      “I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The\\n      Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is\\n      alone.”\\n\\n      “My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what\\n      I tell you. You can tell your friends that we should have been\\n      happy to have come with you, but that urgent business required us\\n      to be in town. We hope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will\\n      you remember to give them that message?”\\n\\n      “If you insist upon it.”\\n\\n      “There is no alternative, I assure you.”\\n\\n      I saw by the baronet’s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by\\n      what he regarded as our desertion.\\n\\n      “When do you desire to go?” he asked coldly.\\n\\n      “Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey,\\n      but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come\\n      back to you. Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell\\n      him that you regret that you cannot come.”\\n\\n      “I have a good mind to go to London with you,” said the baronet.\\n      “Why should I stay here alone?”\\n\\n      “Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word\\n      that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.”\\n\\n      “All right, then, I’ll stay.”\\n\\n      “One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send\\n      back your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to\\n      walk home.”\\n\\n      “To walk across the moor?”\\n\\n      “Yes.”\\n\\n      “But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me\\n      not to do.”\\n\\n      “This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every\\n      confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but\\n      it is essential that you should do it.”\\n\\n      “Then I will do it.”\\n\\n      “And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any\\n      direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit\\n      House to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.”\\n\\n      “I will do just what you say.”\\n\\n      “Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast\\n      as possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.”\\n\\n      I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that\\n      Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit\\n      would terminate next day. It had not crossed my mind however,\\n      that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand how\\n      we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to\\n      be critical. There was nothing for it, however, but implicit\\n      obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend, and a couple\\n      of hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey and\\n      had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A small boy was\\n      waiting upon the platform.\\n\\n      “Any orders, sir?”\\n\\n      “You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you\\n      arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name,\\n      to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is\\n      to send it by registered post to Baker Street.”\\n\\n      “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n      “And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.”\\n\\n      The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It\\n      ran:\\n\\n      Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive\\n      five-forty. Lestrade.\\n\\n      “That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the\\n      professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now,\\n      Watson, I think that we cannot employ our time better than by\\n      calling upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.”\\n\\n      His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use\\n      the baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were\\n      really gone, while we should actually return at the instant when\\n      we were likely to be needed. That telegram from London, if\\n      mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons, must remove the last\\n      suspicions from their minds. Already I seemed to see our nets\\n      drawing closer around that lean-jawed pike.\\n\\n      Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened\\n      his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably\\n      amazed her.\\n\\n      “I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of\\n      the late Sir Charles Baskerville,” said he. “My friend here, Dr.\\n      Watson, has informed me of what you have communicated, and also\\n      of what you have withheld in connection with that matter.”\\n\\n      “What have I withheld?” she asked defiantly.\\n\\n      “You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate\\n      at ten o’clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his\\n      death. You have withheld what the connection is between these\\n      events.”\\n\\n      “There is no connection.”\\n\\n      “In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary\\n      one. But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a\\n      connection, after all. I wish to be perfectly frank with you,\\n      Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as one of murder, and the\\n      evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but his\\n      wife as well.”\\n\\n      The lady sprang from her chair.\\n\\n      “His wife!” she cried.\\n\\n      “The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for\\n      his sister is really his wife.”\\n\\n      Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms\\n      of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with\\n      the pressure of her grip.\\n\\n      “His wife!” she said again. “His wife! He is not a married man.”\\n\\n      Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n      “Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so—!”\\n\\n      The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.\\n\\n      “I have come prepared to do so,” said Holmes, drawing several\\n      papers from his pocket. “Here is a photograph of the couple taken\\n      in York four years ago. It is indorsed ‘Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,’\\n      but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also,\\n      if you know her by sight. Here are three written descriptions by\\n      trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time\\n      kept St. Oliver’s private school. Read them and see if you can\\n      doubt the identity of these people.”\\n\\n      She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid\\n      face of a desperate woman.\\n\\n      “Mr. Holmes,” she said, “this man had offered me marriage on\\n      condition that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied\\n      to me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of\\n      truth has he ever told me. And why—why? I imagined that all was\\n      for my own sake. But now I see that I was never anything but a\\n      tool in his hands. Why should I preserve faith with him who never\\n      kept any with me? Why should I try to shield him from the\\n      consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you like, and\\n      there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear to\\n      you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of\\n      any harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.”\\n\\n      “I entirely believe you, madam,” said Sherlock Holmes. “The\\n      recital of these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps\\n      it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can\\n      check me if I make any material mistake. The sending of this\\n      letter was suggested to you by Stapleton?”\\n\\n      “He dictated it.”\\n\\n      “I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive\\n      help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your\\n      divorce?”\\n\\n      “Exactly.”\\n\\n      “And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from\\n      keeping the appointment?”\\n\\n      “He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other\\n      man should find the money for such an object, and that though he\\n      was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing\\n      the obstacles which divided us.”\\n\\n      “He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard\\n      nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?”\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with\\n      Sir Charles?”\\n\\n      “He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and\\n      that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He\\n      frightened me into remaining silent.”\\n\\n      “Quite so. But you had your suspicions?”\\n\\n      She hesitated and looked down.\\n\\n      “I knew him,” she said. “But if he had kept faith with me I\\n      should always have done so with him.”\\n\\n      “I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,” said\\n      Sherlock Holmes. “You have had him in your power and he knew it,\\n      and yet you are alive. You have been walking for some months very\\n      near to the edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning\\n      now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortly\\n      hear from us again.”\\n\\n      “Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty\\n      thins away in front of us,” said Holmes as we stood waiting for\\n      the arrival of the express from town. “I shall soon be in the\\n      position of being able to put into a single connected narrative\\n      one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times.\\n      Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in\\n      Godno, in Little Russia, in the year ’66, and of course there are\\n      the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possesses\\n      some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no\\n      clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much\\n      surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this\\n      night.”\\n\\n      The London express came roaring into the station, and a small,\\n      wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We\\n      all three shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way\\n      in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a\\n      good deal since the days when they had first worked together. I\\n      could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner\\n      used then to excite in the practical man.\\n\\n      “Anything good?” he asked.\\n\\n      “The biggest thing for years,” said Holmes. “We have two hours\\n      before we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in\\n      getting some dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London\\n      fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night\\n      air of Dartmoor. Never been there? Ah, well, I don’t suppose you\\n      will forget your first visit.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14.\\n\\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\\n\\n      One of Sherlock Holmes’s defects—if, indeed, one may call it a\\n      defect—was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full\\n      plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment.\\n      Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which\\n      loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partly\\n      also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take\\n      any chances. The result, however, was very trying for those who\\n      were acting as his agents and assistants. I had often suffered\\n      under it, but never more so than during that long drive in the\\n      darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were\\n      about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,\\n      and I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My\\n      nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon\\n      our faces and the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow\\n      road told me that we were back upon the moor once again. Every\\n      stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us\\n      nearer to our supreme adventure.\\n\\n      Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of\\n      the hired wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial\\n      matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation.\\n      It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint, when we at\\n      last passed Frankland’s house and knew that we were drawing near\\n      to the Hall and to the scene of action. We did not drive up to\\n      the door but got down near the gate of the avenue. The wagonette\\n      was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith,\\n      while we started to walk to Merripit House.\\n\\n      “Are you armed, Lestrade?”\\n\\n      The little detective smiled. “As long as I have my trousers I\\n      have a hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have\\n      something in it.”\\n\\n      “Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.”\\n\\n      “You’re mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What’s the\\n      game now?”\\n\\n      “A waiting game.”\\n\\n      “My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,” said the\\n      detective with a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes\\n      of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the\\n      Grimpen Mire. “I see the lights of a house ahead of us.”\\n\\n      “That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must\\n      request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.”\\n\\n      We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the\\n      house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards\\n      from it.\\n\\n      “This will do,” said he. “These rocks upon the right make an\\n      admirable screen.”\\n\\n      “We are to wait here?”\\n\\n      “Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,\\n      Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson?\\n      Can you tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed\\n      windows at this end?”\\n\\n      “I think they are the kitchen windows.”\\n\\n      “And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?”\\n\\n      “That is certainly the dining-room.”\\n\\n      “The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep\\n      forward quietly and see what they are doing—but for heaven’s sake\\n      don’t let them know that they are watched!”\\n\\n      I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which\\n      surrounded the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached\\n      a point whence I could look straight through the uncurtained\\n      window.\\n\\n      There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton.\\n      They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the\\n      round table. Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and\\n      wine were in front of them. Stapleton was talking with animation,\\n      but the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought of\\n      that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily\\n      upon his mind.\\n\\n      As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir\\n      Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair,\\n      puffing at his cigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp\\n      sound of boots upon gravel. The steps passed along the path on\\n      the other side of the wall under which I crouched. Looking over,\\n      I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out-house in the\\n      corner of the orchard. A key turned in a lock, and as he passed\\n      in there was a curious scuffling noise from within. He was only a\\n      minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn once more and\\n      he passed me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his guest,\\n      and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to\\n      tell them what I had seen.\\n\\n      “You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?” Holmes asked when\\n      I had finished my report.\\n\\n      “No.”\\n\\n      “Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other\\n      room except the kitchen?”\\n\\n      “I cannot think where she is.”\\n\\n      I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense,\\n      white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked\\n      itself up like a wall on that side of us, low but thick and well\\n      defined. The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great\\n      shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks\\n      borne upon its surface. Holmes’s face was turned towards it, and\\n      he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.\\n\\n      “It’s moving towards us, Watson.”\\n\\n      “Is that serious?”\\n\\n      “Very serious, indeed—the one thing upon earth which could have\\n      disarranged my plans. He can’t be very long, now. It is already\\n      ten o’clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his\\n      coming out before the fog is over the path.”\\n\\n      The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and\\n      bright, while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft,\\n      uncertain light. Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its\\n      serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the\\n      silver-spangled sky. Broad bars of golden light from the lower\\n      windows stretched across the orchard and the moor. One of them\\n      was suddenly shut off. The servants had left the kitchen. There\\n      only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men, the\\n      murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted over\\n      their cigars.\\n\\n      Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of\\n      the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the\\n      first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of\\n      the lighted window. The farther wall of the orchard was already\\n      invisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white\\n      vapour. As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both\\n      corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on\\n      which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship\\n      upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the\\n      rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience.\\n\\n      “If he isn’t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be\\n      covered. In half an hour we won’t be able to see our hands in\\n      front of us.”\\n\\n      “Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?”\\n\\n      “Yes, I think it would be as well.”\\n\\n      So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we\\n      were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea,\\n      with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and\\n      inexorably on.\\n\\n      “We are going too far,” said Holmes. “We dare not take the chance\\n      of his being overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs we\\n      must hold our ground where we are.” He dropped on his knees and\\n      clapped his ear to the ground. “Thank God, I think that I hear\\n      him coming.”\\n\\n      A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching\\n      among the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in\\n      front of us. The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as\\n      through a curtain, there stepped the man whom we were awaiting.\\n      He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear,\\n      starlit night. Then he came swiftly along the path, passed close\\n      to where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us. As he\\n      walked he glanced continually over either shoulder, like a man\\n      who is ill at ease.\\n\\n      “Hist!” cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking\\n      pistol. “Look out! It’s coming!”\\n\\n      There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the\\n      heart of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of\\n      where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what\\n      horror was about to break from the heart of it. I was at Holmes’s\\n      elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale and\\n      exultant, his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight. But\\n      suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his\\n      lips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade gave a\\n      yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground. I\\n      sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind\\n      paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from\\n      the shadows of the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black\\n      hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire\\n      burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering\\n      glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in\\n      flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of a disordered\\n      brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more hellish be\\n      conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us\\n      out of the wall of fog.\\n\\n      With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the\\n      track, following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So\\n      paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass\\n      before we had recovered our nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired\\n      together, and the creature gave a hideous howl, which showed that\\n      one at least had hit him. He did not pause, however, but bounded\\n      onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back, his\\n      face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in horror, glaring\\n      helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down. But\\n      that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the\\n      winds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound\\n      him we could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran\\n      that night. I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as\\n      much as I outpaced the little professional. In front of us as we\\n      flew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and\\n      the deep roar of the hound. I was in time to see the beast spring\\n      upon its victim, hurl him to the ground, and worry at his throat.\\n      But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his\\n      revolver into the creature’s flank. With a last howl of agony and\\n      a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet\\n      pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped,\\n      panting, and pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head,\\n      but it was useless to press the trigger. The giant hound was\\n      dead.\\n\\n      Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his\\n      collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw\\n      that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in\\n      time. Already our friend’s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble\\n      effort to move. Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the\\n      baronet’s teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.\\n\\n      “My God!” he whispered. “What was it? What, in heaven’s name, was\\n      it?”\\n\\n      “It’s dead, whatever it is,” said Holmes. “We’ve laid the family\\n      ghost once and forever.”\\n\\n      In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was\\n      lying stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it\\n      was not a pure mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of\\n      the two—gaunt, savage, and as large as a small lioness. Even now\\n      in the stillness of death, the huge jaws seemed to be dripping\\n      with a bluish flame and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were\\n      ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle, and\\n      as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the\\n      darkness.\\n\\n      “Phosphorus,” I said.\\n\\n      “A cunning preparation of it,” said Holmes, sniffing at the dead\\n      animal. “There is no smell which might have interfered with his\\n      power of scent. We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having\\n      exposed you to this fright. I was prepared for a hound, but not\\n      for such a creature as this. And the fog gave us little time to\\n      receive him.”\\n\\n      “You have saved my life.”\\n\\n      “Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?”\\n\\n      “Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for\\n      anything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to\\n      do?”\\n\\n      “To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures\\n      tonight. If you will wait, one or other of us will go back with\\n      you to the Hall.”\\n\\n      He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale\\n      and trembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he\\n      sat shivering with his face buried in his hands.\\n\\n      “We must leave you now,” said Holmes. “The rest of our work must\\n      be done, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and\\n      now we only want our man.\\n\\n      “It’s a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,” he\\n      continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. “Those\\n      shots must have told him that the game was up.”\\n\\n      “We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.”\\n\\n      “He followed the hound to call him off—of that you may be\\n      certain. No, no, he’s gone by this time! But we’ll search the\\n      house and make sure.”\\n\\n      The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to\\n      room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us\\n      in the passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but\\n      Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house\\n      unexplored. No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing.\\n      On the upper floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was locked.\\n\\n      “There’s someone in here,” cried Lestrade. “I can hear a\\n      movement. Open this door!”\\n\\n      A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the\\n      door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew\\n      open. Pistol in hand, we all three rushed into the room.\\n\\n      But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant\\n      villain whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an\\n      object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment\\n      staring at it in amazement.\\n\\n      The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls\\n      were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that\\n      collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had\\n      been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man. In the\\n      centre of this room there was an upright beam, which had been\\n      placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk\\n      of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a figure was tied,\\n      so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to\\n      secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was\\n      that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and\\n      was secured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower\\n      part of the face, and over it two dark eyes—eyes full of grief\\n      and shame and a dreadful questioning—stared back at us. In a\\n      minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs.\\n      Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. As her beautiful\\n      head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash\\n      across her neck.\\n\\n      “The brute!” cried Holmes. “Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle!\\n      Put her in the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and\\n      exhaustion.”\\n\\n      She opened her eyes again.\\n\\n      “Is he safe?” she asked. “Has he escaped?”\\n\\n      “He cannot escape us, madam.”\\n\\n      “No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?”\\n\\n      “Yes.”\\n\\n      “And the hound?”\\n\\n      “It is dead.”\\n\\n      She gave a long sigh of satisfaction.\\n\\n      “Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated\\n      me!” She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with\\n      horror that they were all mottled with bruises. “But this is\\n      nothing—nothing! It is my mind and soul that he has tortured and\\n      defiled. I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of\\n      deception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the hope\\n      that I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have been\\n      his dupe and his tool.” She broke into passionate sobbing as she\\n      spoke.\\n\\n      “You bear him no good will, madam,” said Holmes. “Tell us then\\n      where we shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help\\n      us now and so atone.”\\n\\n      “There is but one place where he can have fled,” she answered.\\n      “There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire.\\n      It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made\\n      preparations so that he might have a refuge. That is where he\\n      would fly.”\\n\\n      The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held\\n      the lamp towards it.\\n\\n      “See,” said he. “No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire\\n      tonight.”\\n\\n      She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed\\n      with fierce merriment.\\n\\n      “He may find his way in, but never out,” she cried. “How can he\\n      see the guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and\\n      I, to mark the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have\\n      plucked them out today. Then indeed you would have had him at\\n      your mercy!”\\n\\n      It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog\\n      had lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house\\n      while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville\\n      Hall. The story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld\\n      from him, but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth\\n      about the woman whom he had loved. But the shock of the night’s\\n      adventures had shattered his nerves, and before morning he lay\\n      delirious in a high fever under the care of Dr. Mortimer. The two\\n      of them were destined to travel together round the world before\\n      Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he had\\n      been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.\\n\\n      And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular\\n      narrative, in which I have tried to make the reader share those\\n      dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and\\n      ended in so tragic a manner. On the morning after the death of\\n      the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton\\n      to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog. It\\n      helped us to realise the horror of this woman’s life when we saw\\n      the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband’s\\n      track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm,\\n      peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the\\n      end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the\\n      path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those\\n      green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the\\n      stranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour\\n      of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces, while a\\n      false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark,\\n      quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around\\n      our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked,\\n      and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was\\n      tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful\\n      was the clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that\\n      someone had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft\\n      of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing\\n      was projecting. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the\\n      path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he\\n      could never have set his foot upon firm land again. He held an\\n      old black boot in the air. “Meyers, Toronto,” was printed on the\\n      leather inside.\\n\\n      “It is worth a mud bath,” said he. “It is our friend Sir Henry’s\\n      missing boot.”\\n\\n      “Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.”\\n\\n      “Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the\\n      hound upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still\\n      clutching it. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight.\\n      We know at least that he came so far in safety.”\\n\\n      But more than that we were never destined to know, though there\\n      was much which we might surmise. There was no chance of finding\\n      footsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon\\n      them, but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass\\n      we all looked eagerly for them. But no slightest sign of them\\n      ever met our eyes. If the earth told a true story, then Stapleton\\n      never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled\\n      through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in the heart of\\n      the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass\\n      which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is\\n      forever buried.\\n\\n      Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had\\n      hid his savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled\\n      with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it\\n      were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners, driven\\n      away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp. In one\\n      of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones\\n      showed where the animal had been confined. A skeleton with a\\n      tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the _débris_.\\n\\n      “A dog!” said Holmes. “By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor\\n      Mortimer will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that\\n      this place contains any secret which we have not already\\n      fathomed. He could hide his hound, but he could not hush its\\n      voice, and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not\\n      pleasant to hear. On an emergency he could keep the hound in the\\n      out-house at Merripit, but it was always a risk, and it was only\\n      on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end of all his\\n      efforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no doubt\\n      the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was\\n      suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and\\n      by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the\\n      poor devil of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did,\\n      and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw such a creature\\n      bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track. It was\\n      a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving your\\n      victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too\\n      closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many\\n      have done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson, and I say\\n      it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more\\n      dangerous man than he who is lying yonder”—he swept his long arm\\n      towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which\\n      stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the\\n      moor.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15.\\n\\nA Retrospection\\n\\n      It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and\\n      foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room\\n      in Baker Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to\\n      Devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost\\n      importance, in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious\\n      conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection with the famous card\\n      scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second he had\\n      defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge of\\n      murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her\\n      step-daughter, Mlle. Carére, the young lady who, as it will be\\n      remembered, was found six months later alive and married in New\\n      York. My friend was in excellent spirits over the success which\\n      had attended a succession of difficult and important cases, so\\n      that I was able to induce him to discuss the details of the\\n      Baskerville mystery. I had waited patiently for the opportunity\\n      for I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, and\\n      that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its\\n      present work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir Henry and\\n      Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that long\\n      voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his\\n      shattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so\\n      that it was natural that the subject should come up for\\n      discussion.\\n\\n      “The whole course of events,” said Holmes, “from the point of\\n      view of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and\\n      direct, although to us, who had no means in the beginning of\\n      knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of\\n      the facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex. I have had the\\n      advantage of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton, and the case\\n      has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that\\n      there is anything which has remained a secret to us. You will\\n      find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my\\n      indexed list of cases.”\\n\\n      “Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of\\n      events from memory.”\\n\\n      “Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts\\n      in my mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of\\n      blotting out what has passed. The barrister who has his case at\\n      his fingers’ ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his\\n      own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it\\n      all out of his head once more. So each of my cases displaces the\\n      last, and Mlle. Carére has blurred my recollection of Baskerville\\n      Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my\\n      notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French lady and the\\n      infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes, however, I\\n      will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and you\\n      will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.\\n\\n      “My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait\\n      did not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He\\n      was a son of that Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir\\n      Charles, who fled with a sinister reputation to South America,\\n      where he was said to have died unmarried. He did, as a matter of\\n      fact, marry, and had one child, this fellow, whose real name is\\n      the same as his father’s. He married Beryl Garcia, one of the\\n      beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a considerable sum\\n      of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and fled to\\n      England, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire.\\n      His reason for attempting this special line of business was that\\n      he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon\\n      the voyage home, and that he had used this man’s ability to make\\n      the undertaking a success. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and\\n      the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy.\\n      The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to\\n      Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his fortune, his schemes\\n      for the future, and his taste for entomology to the south of\\n      England. I learned at the British Museum that he was a recognized\\n      authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur has\\n      been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his\\n      Yorkshire days, been the first to describe.\\n\\n      “We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be\\n      of such intense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made\\n      inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and\\n      a valuable estate. When he went to Devonshire his plans were, I\\n      believe, exceedingly hazy, but that he meant mischief from the\\n      first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him\\n      in the character of his sister. The idea of using her as a decoy\\n      was clearly already in his mind, though he may not have been\\n      certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He meant\\n      in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool\\n      or run any risk for that end. His first act was to establish\\n      himself as near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second\\n      was to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and\\n      with the neighbours.\\n\\n      “The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so\\n      prepared the way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue\\n      to call him, knew that the old man’s heart was weak and that a\\n      shock would kill him. So much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer.\\n      He had heard also that Sir Charles was superstitious and had\\n      taken this grim legend very seriously. His ingenious mind\\n      instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to\\n      death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the\\n      guilt to the real murderer.\\n\\n      “Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with\\n      considerable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content\\n      to work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to make\\n      the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. The\\n      dog he bought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in\\n      Fulham Road. It was the strongest and most savage in their\\n      possession. He brought it down by the North Devon line and walked\\n      a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without\\n      exciting any remarks. He had already on his insect hunts learned\\n      to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a safe\\n      hiding-place for the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited\\n      his chance.\\n\\n      “But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be\\n      decoyed outside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapleton\\n      lurked about with his hound, but without avail. It was during\\n      these fruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen by\\n      peasants, and that the legend of the demon dog received a new\\n      confirmation. He had hoped that his wife might lure Sir Charles\\n      to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly independent. She\\n      would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a\\n      sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy.\\n      Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her.\\n      She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton\\n      was at a deadlock.\\n\\n      “He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that\\n      Sir Charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the\\n      minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman,\\n      Mrs. Laura Lyons. By representing himself as a single man he\\n      acquired complete influence over her, and he gave her to\\n      understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her\\n      husband he would marry her. His plans were suddenly brought to a\\n      head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the\\n      Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he himself\\n      pretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim might\\n      get beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons\\n      to write this letter, imploring the old man to give her an\\n      interview on the evening before his departure for London. He\\n      then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so\\n      had the chance for which he had waited.\\n\\n      “Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to\\n      get his hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring\\n      the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that\\n      he would find the old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its\\n      master, sprang over the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate\\n      baronet, who fled screaming down the yew alley. In that gloomy\\n      tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge\\n      black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding\\n      after its victim. He fell dead at the end of the alley from heart\\n      disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the grassy border\\n      while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but the\\n      man’s was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had\\n      probably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had\\n      turned away again. It was then that it left the print which was\\n      actually observed by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and\\n      hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was\\n      left which puzzled the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and\\n      finally brought the case within the scope of our observation.\\n\\n      “So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive\\n      the devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost\\n      impossible to make a case against the real murderer. His only\\n      accomplice was one who could never give him away, and the\\n      grotesque, inconceivable nature of the device only served to make\\n      it more effective. Both of the women concerned in the case, Mrs.\\n      Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a strong suspicion\\n      against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he had designs upon\\n      the old man, and also of the existence of the hound. Mrs. Lyons\\n      knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the death\\n      occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was\\n      only known to him. However, both of them were under his\\n      influence, and he had nothing to fear from them. The first half\\n      of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult\\n      still remained.\\n\\n      “It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of\\n      an heir in Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from\\n      his friend Dr. Mortimer, and he was told by the latter all\\n      details about the arrival of Henry Baskerville. Stapleton’s first\\n      idea was that this young stranger from Canada might possibly be\\n      done to death in London without coming down to Devonshire at all.\\n      He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in\\n      laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her long\\n      out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her.\\n      It was for this reason that he took her to London with him. They\\n      lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven\\n      Street, which was actually one of those called upon by my agent\\n      in search of evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her\\n      room while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to\\n      Baker Street and afterwards to the station and to the\\n      Northumberland Hotel. His wife had some inkling of his plans; but\\n      she had such a fear of her husband—a fear founded upon brutal\\n      ill-treatment—that she dare not write to warn the man whom she\\n      knew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into Stapleton’s\\n      hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we know, she\\n      adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form\\n      the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. It\\n      reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his\\n      danger.\\n\\n      “It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir\\n      Henry’s attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he\\n      might always have the means of setting him upon his track. With\\n      characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once,\\n      and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel\\n      was well bribed to help him in his design. By chance, however,\\n      the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and,\\n      therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had it returned and\\n      obtained another—a most instructive incident, since it proved\\n      conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,\\n      as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an\\n      old boot and this indifference to a new one. The more _outré_ and\\n      grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be\\n      examined, and the very point which appears to complicate a case\\n      is, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the one\\n      which is most likely to elucidate it.\\n\\n      “Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed\\n      always by Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our rooms\\n      and of my appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am\\n      inclined to think that Stapleton’s career of crime has been by no\\n      means limited to this single Baskerville affair. It is suggestive\\n      that during the last three years there have been four\\n      considerable burglaries in the west country, for none of which\\n      was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at Folkestone\\n      Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling of\\n      the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot\\n      doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this\\n      fashion, and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous\\n      man.\\n\\n      “We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when\\n      he got away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in\\n      sending back my own name to me through the cabman. From that\\n      moment he understood that I had taken over the case in London,\\n      and that therefore there was no chance for him there. He returned\\n      to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet.”\\n\\n      “One moment!” said I. “You have, no doubt, described the sequence\\n      of events correctly, but there is one point which you have left\\n      unexplained. What became of the hound when its master was in\\n      London?”\\n\\n      “I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly\\n      of importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a\\n      confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in\\n      his power by sharing all his plans with him. There was an old\\n      manservant at Merripit House, whose name was Anthony. His\\n      connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years,\\n      as far back as the school-mastering days, so that he must have\\n      been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and\\n      wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country.\\n      It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,\\n      while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries.\\n      The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but\\n      with a curious lisping accent. I have myself seen this old man\\n      cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had marked\\n      out. It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of his\\n      master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may never\\n      have known the purpose for which the beast was used.\\n\\n      “The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were\\n      soon followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I\\n      stood myself at that time. It may possibly recur to your memory\\n      that when I examined the paper upon which the printed words were\\n      fastened I made a close inspection for the water-mark. In doing\\n      so I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was conscious of\\n      a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine. There are\\n      seventy-five perfumes, which it is very necessary that a criminal\\n      expert should be able to distinguish from each other, and cases\\n      have more than once within my own experience depended upon their\\n      prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a lady,\\n      and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons.\\n      Thus I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the\\n      criminal before ever we went to the west country.\\n\\n      “It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that\\n      I could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly\\n      on his guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included,\\n      and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My\\n      hardships were not so great as you imagined, though such trifling\\n      details must never interfere with the investigation of a case. I\\n      stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut\\n      upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of\\n      action. Cartwright had come down with me, and in his disguise as\\n      a country boy he was of great assistance to me. I was dependent\\n      upon him for food and clean linen. When I was watching Stapleton,\\n      Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I was able to\\n      keep my hand upon all the strings.\\n\\n      “I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly,\\n      being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey.\\n      They were of great service to me, and especially that one\\n      incidentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton’s. I was\\n      able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew\\n      at last exactly how I stood. The case had been considerably\\n      complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the\\n      relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you cleared\\n      up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the same\\n      conclusions from my own observations.\\n\\n      “By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a\\n      complete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case\\n      which could go to a jury. Even Stapleton’s attempt upon Sir Henry\\n      that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict\\n      did not help us much in proving murder against our man. There\\n      seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and to\\n      do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected,\\n      as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to our\\n      client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton\\n      to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been exposed to\\n      this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case,\\n      but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing\\n      spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog\\n      which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. We\\n      succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and\\n      Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one. A long journey\\n      may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered\\n      nerves but also from his wounded feelings. His love for the lady\\n      was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this\\n      black business was that he should have been deceived by her.\\n\\n      “It only remains to indicate the part which she had played\\n      throughout. There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an\\n      influence over her which may have been love or may have been\\n      fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means\\n      incompatible emotions. It was, at least, absolutely effective. At\\n      his command she consented to pass as his sister, though he found\\n      the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her\\n      the direct accessory to murder. She was ready to warn Sir Henry\\n      so far as she could without implicating her husband, and again\\n      and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have\\n      been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying\\n      court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still\\n      he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which\\n      revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so\\n      cleverly concealed. By encouraging the intimacy he made it\\n      certain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit House\\n      and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he\\n      desired. On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned\\n      suddenly against him. She had learned something of the death of\\n      the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the\\n      outhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She\\n      taxed her husband with his intended crime, and a furious scene\\n      followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a\\n      rival in his love. Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter\\n      hatred, and he saw that she would betray him. He tied her up,\\n      therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry,\\n      and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put down\\n      the baronet’s death to the curse of his family, as they certainly\\n      would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished\\n      fact and to keep silent upon what she knew. In this I fancy that\\n      in any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not\\n      been there, his doom would none the less have been sealed. A\\n      woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an injury so\\n      lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes,\\n      I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case. I\\n      do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained.”\\n\\n      “He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done\\n      the old uncle with his bogie hound.”\\n\\n      “The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not\\n      frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the\\n      resistance which might be offered.”\\n\\n      “No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came\\n      into the succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the\\n      heir, had been living unannounced under another name so close to\\n      the property? How could he claim it without causing suspicion and\\n      inquiry?”\\n\\n      “It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much\\n      when you expect me to solve it. The past and the present are\\n      within the field of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the\\n      future is a hard question to answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her\\n      husband discuss the problem on several occasions. There were\\n      three possible courses. He might claim the property from South\\n      America, establish his identity before the British authorities\\n      there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to England at\\n      all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short\\n      time that he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish an\\n      accomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir,\\n      and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. We\\n      cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found\\n      some way out of the difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have\\n      had some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we\\n      may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels. I have a box\\n      for _Les Huguenots_. Have you heard the De Reszkes? Might I\\n      trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we can stop at\\n      Marcini’s for a little dinner on the way?”\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n'"

was seated at the breakfast table  i stood upon the       hearth rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left       behind him the night before  it was a fine  thick piece of wood        bulbous headed  of the sort which is known as a  penang lawyer         just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch       across   to james mortimer  m r c s   from his friends of the       c c h    was engraved upon it  with the date         it was just       such a stick as the old fashioned family practitioner used to       carry dignified  solid  and reassuring          well  watson  what do you make of it          holmes was sitting with his back to me  and i had given him no       sign of my occupation          how did you know what i was doing  i believe you have eyes in       the back of your head           i have  at least  a well polished  silver plated coffee pot in       front of me   said he   but  tell me  watson  what do you make of       our visitor s stick  since we have been so unfortunate as to miss       him and have no notion of his errand  this accidental souvenir       becomes of importance  let me hear you reconstruct the man by an       examination of it           i think   said i  following as far as i could the methods of my       companion   that dr  mortimer is a successful  elderly medical       man  well esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of       their appreciation           good   said holmes   excellent           i think also that the probability is in favour of his being a       country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on       foot           why so           because this stick  though originally a very handsome one has       been so knocked about that i can hardly imagine a town       practitioner carrying it  the thick iron ferrule is worn down  so       it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with       it           perfectly sound   said holmes          and then again  there is the  friends of the c c h   i should       guess that to be the something hunt  the local hunt to whose       members he has possibly given some surgical assistance  and which       has made him a small presentation in return           really  watson  you excel yourself   said holmes  pushing back       his chair and lighting a cigarette   i am bound to say that in       all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own       small achievements you have habitually underrated your own       abilities  it may be that you are not yourself luminous  but you       are a conductor of light  some people without possessing genius       have a remarkable power of stimulating it  i confess  my dear       fellow  that i am very much in your debt          he had never said as much before  and i must admit that his words       gave me keen pleasure  for i had often been piqued by his       indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which i had       made to give publicity to his methods  i was proud  too  to think       that i had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way       which earned his approval  he now took the stick from my hands       and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes  then with       an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette  and       carrying the cane to the window  he looked over it again with a       convex lens          interesting  though elementary   said he as he returned to his       favourite corner of the settee   there are certainly one or two       indications upon the stick  it gives us the basis for several       deductions           has anything escaped me   i asked with some self importance   i       trust that there is nothing of consequence which i have       overlooked           i am afraid  my dear watson  that most of your conclusions were       erroneous  when i said that you stimulated me i meant  to be       frank  that in noting your fallacies i was occasionally guided       towards the truth  not that you are entirely wrong in this       instance  the man is certainly a country practitioner  and he       walks a good deal           then i was right           to that extent           but that was all           no  no  my dear watson  not all by no means all  i would       suggest  for example  that a presentation to a doctor is more       likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt  and that when       the initials  c c   are placed before that hospital the words        charing cross  very naturally suggest themselves           you may be right           the probability lies in that direction  and if we take this as a       working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our       construction of this unknown visitor           well  then  supposing that  c c h   does stand for  charing       cross hospital   what further inferences may we draw           do none suggest themselves  you know my methods  apply them           i can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has       practised in town before going to the country           i think that we might venture a little farther than this  look       at it in this light  on what occasion would it be most probable       that such a presentation would be made  when would his friends       unite to give him a pledge of their good will  obviously at the       moment when dr  mortimer withdrew from the service of the       hospital in order to start a practice for himself  we know there       has been a presentation  we believe there has been a change from       a town hospital to a country practice  is it  then  stretching       our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the       occasion of the change           it certainly seems probable           now  you will observe that he could not have been on the  staff        of the hospital  since only a man well established in a london       practice could hold such a position  and such a one would not       drift into the country  what was he  then  if he was in the       hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a       house surgeon or a house physician little more than a senior       student  and he left five years ago the date is on the stick  so       your grave  middle aged family practitioner vanishes into thin       air  my dear watson  and there emerges a young fellow under       thirty  amiable  unambitious  absent minded  and the possessor of       a favourite dog  which i should describe roughly as being larger       than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff          i laughed incredulously as sherlock holmes leaned back in his       settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling          as to the latter part  i have no means of checking you   said i         but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars       about the man s age and professional career   from my small       medical shelf i took down the medical directory and turned up the       name  there were several mortimers  but only one who could be our       visitor  i read his record aloud            mortimer  james  m r c s         grimpen  dartmoor  devon          house surgeon  from      to       at charing cross hospital          winner of the jackson prize for comparative pathology  with         essay entitled  is disease a reversion    corresponding member         of the swedish pathological society   author of  some freaks of         atavism    lancet           do we progress     journal of         psychology   march         medical officer for the parishes of         grimpen  thorsley  and high barrow           no mention of that local hunt  watson   said holmes with a       mischievous smile   but a country doctor  as you very astutely       observed  i think that i am fairly justified in my inferences  as       to the adjectives  i said  if i remember right  amiable        unambitious  and absent minded  it is my experience that it is       only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials  only       an unambitious one who abandons a london career for the country        and only an absent minded one who leaves his stick and not his       visiting card after waiting an hour in your room           and the dog           has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master        being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle        and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible  the dog s       jaw  as shown in the space between these marks  is too broad in       my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff  it       may have been yes  by jove  it  is  a curly haired spaniel          he had risen and paced the room as he spoke  now he halted in the       recess of the window  there was such a ring of conviction in his       voice that i glanced up in surprise          my dear fellow  how can you possibly be so sure of that           for the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our       very door step  and there is the ring of its owner  don t move  i       beg you  watson  he is a professional brother of yours  and your       presence may be of assistance to me  now is the dramatic moment       of fate  watson  when you hear a step upon the stair which is       walking into your life  and you know not whether for good or ill        what does dr  james mortimer  the man of science  ask of sherlock       holmes  the specialist in crime  come in          the appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me  since i had       expected a typical country practitioner  he was a very tall  thin       man  with a long nose like a beak  which jutted out between two       keen  grey eyes  set closely together and sparkling brightly from       behind a pair of gold rimmed glasses  he was clad in a       professional but rather slovenly fashion  for his frock coat was       dingy and his trousers frayed  though young  his long back was       already bowed  and he walked with a forward thrust of his head       and a general air of peering benevolence  as he entered his eyes       fell upon the stick in holmes s hand  and he ran towards it with       an exclamation of joy   i am so very glad   said he   i was not       sure whether i had left it here or in the shipping office  i       would not lose that stick for the world           a presentation  i see   said holmes          yes  sir           from charing cross hospital           from one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage           dear  dear  that s bad   said holmes  shaking his head         dr  mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment         why was it bad           only that you have disarranged our little deductions  your       marriage  you say           yes  sir  i married  and so left the hospital  and with it all       hopes of a consulting practice  it was necessary to make a home       of my own           come  come  we are not so far wrong  after all   said holmes         and now  dr  james mortimer           mister  sir  mister a humble m r c s           and a man of precise mind  evidently           a dabbler in science  mr  holmes  a picker up of shells on the       shores of the great unknown ocean  i presume that it is mr        sherlock holmes whom i am addressing and not           no  this is my friend dr  watson           glad to meet you  sir  i have heard your name mentioned in       connection with that of your friend  you interest me very much        mr  holmes  i had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or       such well marked supra orbital development  would you have any       objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure  a       cast of your skull  sir  until the original is available  would       be an ornament to any anthropological museum  it is not my       intention to be fulsome  but i confess that i covet your skull          sherlock holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair   you are       an enthusiast in your line of thought  i perceive  sir  as i am       in mine   said he   i observe from your forefinger that you make       your own cigarettes  have no hesitation in lighting one          the man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the       other with surprising dexterity  he had long  quivering fingers       as agile and restless as the antenn  of an insect         holmes was silent  but his little darting glances showed me the       interest which he took in our curious companion   i presume        sir   said he at last   that it was not merely for the purpose of       examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here       last night and again today           no  sir  no  though i am happy to have had the opportunity of       doing that as well  i came to you  mr  holmes  because i       recognized that i am myself an unpractical man and because i am       suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary       problem  recognizing  as i do  that you are the second highest       expert in europe           indeed  sir  may i inquire who has the honour to be the first         asked holmes with some asperity          to the man of precisely scientific mind the work of monsieur       bertillon must always appeal strongly           then had you not better consult him           i said  sir  to the precisely scientific mind  but as a       practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone        i trust  sir  that i have not inadvertently           just a little   said holmes   i think  dr  mortimer  you would       do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly       what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my       assistance      chapter     the curse of the baskervilles         i have in my pocket a manuscript   said dr  james mortimer          i observed it as you entered the room   said holmes          it is an old manuscript           early eighteenth century  unless it is a forgery           how can you say that  sir           you have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all       the time that you have been talking  it would be a poor expert       who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so        you may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject        i put that at                the exact date is        dr  mortimer drew it from his       breast pocket   this family paper was committed to my care by sir       charles baskerville  whose sudden and tragic death some three       months ago created so much excitement in devonshire  i may say       that i was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant        he was a strong minded man  sir  shrewd  practical  and as       unimaginative as i am myself  yet he took this document very       seriously  and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did       eventually overtake him          holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it       upon his knee   you will observe  watson  the alternative use of       the long  s  and the short  it is one of several indications       which enabled me to fix the date          i looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded       script  at the head was written   baskerville hall   and below in       large  scrawling figures                  it appears to be a statement of some sort           yes  it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the       baskerville family           but i understand that it is something more modern and practical       upon which you wish to consult me           most modern  a most practical  pressing matter  which must be       decided within twenty four hours  but the manuscript is short and       is intimately connected with the affair  with your permission i       will read it to you          holmes leaned back in his chair  placed his finger tips together        and closed his eyes  with an air of resignation  dr  mortimer       turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high  cracking       voice the following curious  old world narrative            of the origin of the hound of the baskervilles there have been         many statements  yet as i come in a direct line from hugo         baskerville  and as i had the story from my father  who also         had it from his  i have set it down with all belief that it         occurred even as is here set forth  and i would have you         believe  my sons  that the same justice which punishes sin may         also most graciously forgive it  and that no ban is so heavy         but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed   learn         then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past  but         rather to be circumspect in the future  that those foul         passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not         again be loosed to our undoing                know then that in the time of the great rebellion  the             history of which by the learned lord clarendon i most             earnestly commend to your attention  this manor of             baskerville was held by hugo of that name  nor can it be             gainsaid that he was a most wild  profane  and godless man               this  in truth  his neighbours might have pardoned  seeing             that saints have never flourished in those parts  but there             was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his             name a by word through the west   it chanced that this hugo             came to love  if  indeed  so dark a passion may be known             under so bright a name  the daughter of a yeoman who held             lands near the baskerville estate  but the young maiden              being discreet and of good repute  would ever avoid him              for she feared his evil name   so it came to pass that one             michaelmas this hugo  with five or six of his idle and             wicked companions  stole down upon the farm and carried off             the maiden  her father and brothers being from home  as he             well knew   when they had brought her to the hall the             maiden was placed in an upper chamber  while hugo and his             friends sat down to a long carouse  as was their nightly             custom   now  the poor lass upstairs was like to have her             wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths             which came up to her from below  for they say that the             words used by hugo baskerville  when he was in wine  were             such as might blast the man who said them   at last in the             stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted             the bravest or most active man  for by the aid of the             growth of ivy which covered  and still covers  the south             wall she came down from under the eaves  and so homeward             across the moor  there being three leagues betwixt the hall             and her father s farm                it chanced that some little time later hugo left his             guests to carry food and drink with other worse things              perchance to his captive  and so found the cage empty and             the bird escaped   then  as it would seem  he became as one             that hath a devil  for  rushing down the stairs into the             dining hall  he sprang upon the great table  flagons and             trenchers flying before him  and he cried aloud before all             the company that he would that very night render his body             and soul to the powers of evil if he might but overtake the             wench   and while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of             the man  one more wicked or  it may be  more drunken than             the rest  cried out that they should put the hounds upon             her   whereat hugo ran from the house  crying to his grooms             that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack  and             giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid s  he swung them             to the line  and so off full cry in the moonlight over the             moor                now  for some space the revellers stood agape  unable to             understand all that had been done in such haste   but anon             their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which             was like to be done upon the moorlands   everything was now             in an uproar  some calling for their pistols  some for             their horses  and some for another flask of wine   but at             length some sense came back to their crazed minds  and the             whole of them  thirteen in number  took horse and started             in pursuit   the moon shone clear above them  and they rode             swiftly abreast  taking that course which the maid must             needs have taken if she were to reach her own home                they had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the             night shepherds upon the moorlands  and they cried to him             to know if he had seen the hunt   and the man  as the story             goes  was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak              but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy             maiden  with the hounds upon her track    but i have seen             more than that   said he   for hugo baskerville passed me             upon his black mare  and there ran mute behind him such a             hound of hell as god forbid should ever be at my heels                so the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward               but soon their skins turned cold  for there came a             galloping across the moor  and the black mare  dabbled with             white froth  went past with trailing bridle and empty             saddle   then the revellers rode close together  for a             great fear was on them  but they still followed over the             moor  though each  had he been alone  would have been right             glad to have turned his horse s head   riding slowly in             this fashion they came at last upon the hounds   these              though known for their valour and their breed  were             whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal              as we call it  upon the moor  some slinking away and some              with starting hackles and staring eyes  gazing down the             narrow valley before them                the company had come to a halt  more sober men  as you may             guess  than when they started   the most of them would by             no means advance  but three of them  the boldest  or it may             be the most drunken  rode forward down the goyal  now  it             opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great             stones  still to be seen there  which were set by certain             forgotten peoples in the days of old  the moon was shining             bright upon the clearing  and there in the centre lay the             unhappy maid where she had fallen  dead of fear and of             fatigue   but it was not the sight of her body  nor yet was             it that of the body of hugo baskerville lying near her              which raised the hair upon the heads of these three             dare devil roysterers  but it was that  standing over hugo              and plucking at his throat  there stood a foul thing  a             great  black beast  shaped like a hound  yet larger than             any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon   and even             as they looked the thing tore the throat out of hugo             baskerville  on which  as it turned its blazing eyes and             dripping jaws upon them  the three shrieked with fear and             rode for dear life  still screaming  across the moor   one              it is said  died that very night of what he had seen  and             the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their             days                such is the tale  my sons  of the coming of the hound             which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever             since   if i have set it down it is because that which is             clearly known hath less terror than that which is but             hinted at and guessed   nor can it be denied that many of             the family have been unhappy in their deaths  which have             been sudden  bloody  and mysterious   yet may we shelter             ourselves in the infinite goodness of providence  which             would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or             fourth generation which is threatened in holy writ   to             that providence  my sons  i hereby commend you  and i             counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the             moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are             exalted                 this from hugo baskerville to his sons rodger and john              with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their             sister elizabeth           when dr  mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he       pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at mr        sherlock holmes  the latter yawned and tossed the end of his       cigarette into the fire          well   said he          do you not find it interesting           to a collector of fairy tales          dr  mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket          now  mr  holmes  we will give you something a little more       recent  this is the  devon county chronicle  of may   th of this       year  it is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of       sir charles baskerville which occurred a few days before that       date          my friend leaned a little forward and his expression became       intent  our visitor readjusted his glasses and began            the recent sudden death of sir charles baskerville  whose name         has been mentioned as the probable liberal candidate for         mid devon at the next election  has cast a gloom over the         county   though sir charles had resided at baskerville hall for         a comparatively short period his amiability of character and         extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who         had been brought into contact with him   in these days of          nouveaux riches  it is refreshing to find a case where the         scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days         is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him         to restore the fallen grandeur of his line   sir charles  as is         well known  made large sums of money in south african         speculation  more wise than those who go on until the wheel         turns against them  he realised his gains and returned to         england with them   it is only two years since he took up his         residence at baskerville hall  and it is common talk how large         were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have         been interrupted by his death   being himself childless  it was         his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should          within his own lifetime  profit by his good fortune  and many         will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end   his         generous donations to local and county charities have been         frequently chronicled in these columns                the circumstances connected with the death of sir charles             cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the             inquest  but at least enough has been done to dispose of             those rumours to which local superstition has given rise              there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play  or to             imagine that death could be from any but natural causes              sir charles was a widower  and a man who may be said to             have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind  in             spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his             personal tastes  and his indoor servants at baskerville             hall consisted of a married couple named barrymore  the             husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper  their             evidence  corroborated by that of several friends  tends to             show that sir charles s health has for some time been             impaired  and points especially to some affection of the             heart  manifesting itself in changes of colour              breathlessness  and acute attacks of nervous depression              dr  james mortimer  the friend and medical attendant of the             deceased  has given evidence to the same effect                the facts of the case are simple   sir charles baskerville             was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking             down the famous yew alley of baskerville hall   the             evidence of the barrymores shows that this had been his             custom  on the fourth of may sir charles had declared his             intention of starting next day for london  and had ordered             barrymore to prepare his luggage   that night he went out             as usual for his nocturnal walk  in the course of which he             was in the habit of smoking a cigar   he never returned               at twelve o clock barrymore  finding the hall door still             open  became alarmed  and  lighting a lantern  went in             search of his master   the day had been wet  and sir             charles s footmarks were easily traced down the alley               halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on             to the moor  there were indications that sir charles had             stood for some little time here   he then proceeded down             the alley  and it was at the far end of it that his body             was discovered  one fact which has not been explained is             the statement of barrymore that his master s footprints             altered their character from the time that he passed the             moor gate  and that he appeared from thence onward to have             been walking upon his toes   one murphy  a gipsy             horse dealer  was on the moor at no great distance at the             time  but he appears by his own confession to have been the             worse for drink  he declares that he heard cries but is             unable to state from what direction they came   no signs of             violence were to be discovered upon sir charles s person              and though the doctor s evidence pointed to an almost             incredible facial distortion so great that dr  mortimer             refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend             and patient who lay before him it was explained that that             is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspn a and             death from cardiac exhaustion   this explanation was borne             out by the post mortem examination  which showed             long standing organic disease  and the coroner s jury             returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence               it is well that this is so  for it is obviously of the             utmost importance that sir charles s heir should settle at             the hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly             interrupted   had the prosaic finding of the coroner not             finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been             whispered in connection with the affair  it might have been             difficult to find a tenant for baskerville hall   it is             understood that the next of kin is mr  henry baskerville              if he be still alive  the son of sir charles baskerville s             younger brother   the young man when last heard of was in             america  and inquiries are being instituted with a view to             informing him of his good fortune          dr  mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket         those are the public facts  mr  holmes  in connection with the       death of sir charles baskerville           i must thank you   said sherlock holmes   for calling my       attention to a case which certainly presents some features of       interest  i had observed some newspaper comment at the time  but       i was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the       vatican cameos  and in my anxiety to oblige the pope i lost touch       with several interesting english cases  this article  you say        contains all the public facts           it does           then let me have the private ones   he leaned back  put his       finger tips together  and assumed his most impassive and judicial       expression          in doing so   said dr  mortimer  who had begun to show signs of       some strong emotion   i am telling that which i have not confided       to anyone  my motive for withholding it from the coroner s       inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in       the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition        i had the further motive that baskerville hall  as the paper       says  would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to       increase its already rather grim reputation  for both these       reasons i thought that i was justified in telling rather less       than i knew  since no practical good could result from it  but       with you there is no reason why i should not be perfectly frank          the moor is very sparsely inhabited  and those who live near       each other are thrown very much together  for this reason i saw a       good deal of sir charles baskerville  with the exception of mr        frankland  of lafter hall  and mr  stapleton  the naturalist        there are no other men of education within many miles  sir       charles was a retiring man  but the chance of his illness brought       us together  and a community of interests in science kept us so        he had brought back much scientific information from south       africa  and many a charming evening we have spent together       discussing the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the       hottentot          within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me       that sir charles s nervous system was strained to the breaking       point  he had taken this legend which i have read you exceedingly       to heart so much so that  although he would walk in his own       grounds  nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at       night  incredible as it may appear to you  mr  holmes  he was       honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family  and       certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors       were not encouraging  the idea of some ghastly presence       constantly haunted him  and on more than one occasion he has       asked me whether i had on my medical journeys at night ever seen       any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound  the latter       question he put to me several times  and always with a voice       which vibrated with excitement          i can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some       three weeks before the fatal event  he chanced to be at his hall       door  i had descended from my gig and was standing in front of       him  when i saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and       stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror  i       whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something       which i took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the       drive  so excited and alarmed was he that i was compelled to go       down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for       it  it was gone  however  and the incident appeared to make the       worst impression upon his mind  i stayed with him all the       evening  and it was on that occasion  to explain the emotion       which he had shown  that he confided to my keeping that narrative       which i read to you when first i came  i mention this small       episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy       which followed  but i was convinced at the time that the matter       was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no       justification          it was at my advice that sir charles was about to go to london        his heart was  i knew  affected  and the constant anxiety in       which he lived  however chimerical the cause of it might be  was       evidently having a serious effect upon his health  i thought that       a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a       new man  mr  stapleton  a mutual friend who was much concerned at       his state of health  was of the same opinion  at the last instant       came this terrible catastrophe          on the night of sir charles s death barrymore the butler  who       made the discovery  sent perkins the groom on horseback to me        and as i was sitting up late i was able to reach baskerville hall       within an hour of the event  i checked and corroborated all the       facts which were mentioned at the inquest  i followed the       footsteps down the yew alley  i saw the spot at the moor gate       where he seemed to have waited  i remarked the change in the       shape of the prints after that point  i noted that there were no       other footsteps save those of barrymore on the soft gravel  and       finally i carefully examined the body  which had not been touched       until my arrival  sir charles lay on his face  his arms out  his       fingers dug into the ground  and his features convulsed with some       strong emotion to such an extent that i could hardly have sworn       to his identity  there was certainly no physical injury of any       kind  but one false statement was made by barrymore at the       inquest  he said that there were no traces upon the ground round       the body  he did not observe any  but i did some little distance       off  but fresh and clear           footprints           footprints           a man s or a woman s          dr  mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant  and his voice       sank almost to a whisper as he answered          mr  holmes  they were the footprints of a gigantic hound      chapter     the problem        i confess at these words a shudder passed through me  there was a       thrill in the doctor s voice which showed that he was himself       deeply moved by that which he told us  holmes leaned forward in       his excitement and his eyes had the hard  dry glitter which shot       from them when he was keenly interested          you saw this           as clearly as i see you           and you said nothing           what was the use           how was it that no one else saw it           the marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave       them a thought  i don t suppose i should have done so had i not       known this legend           there are many sheep dogs on the moor           no doubt  but this was no sheep dog           you say it was large           enormous           but it had not approached the body           no           what sort of night was it           damp and raw           but not actually raining           no           what is the alley like           there are two lines of old yew hedge  twelve feet high and       impenetrable  the walk in the centre is about eight feet across           is there anything between the hedges and the walk           yes  there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either       side           i understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a       gate           yes  the wicket gate which leads on to the moor           is there any other opening           none           so that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it       from the house or else to enter it by the moor gate           there is an exit through a summer house at the far end           had sir charles reached this           no  he lay about fifty yards from it           now  tell me  dr  mortimer and this is important the marks which       you saw were on the path and not on the grass           no marks could show on the grass           were they on the same side of the path as the moor gate           yes  they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the       moor gate           you interest me exceedingly  another point  was the wicket gate       closed           closed and padlocked           how high was it           about four feet high           then anyone could have got over it           yes           and what marks did you see by the wicket gate           none in particular           good heaven  did no one examine           yes  i examined  myself           and found nothing           it was all very confused  sir charles had evidently stood there       for five or ten minutes           how do you know that           because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar           excellent  this is a colleague  watson  after our own heart  but       the marks           he had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel  i       could discern no others          sherlock holmes struck his hand against his knee with an       impatient gesture          if i had only been there   he cried   it is evidently a case of       extraordinary interest  and one which presented immense       opportunities to the scientific expert  that gravel page upon       which i might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by       the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants  oh  dr        mortimer  dr  mortimer  to think that you should not have called       me in  you have indeed much to answer for           i could not call you in  mr  holmes  without disclosing these       facts to the world  and i have already given my reasons for not       wishing to do so  besides  besides           why do you hesitate           there is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of       detectives is helpless           you mean that the thing is supernatural           i did not positively say so           no  but you evidently think it           since the tragedy  mr  holmes  there have come to my ears       several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled       order of nature           for example           i find that before the terrible event occurred several people       had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this       baskerville demon  and which could not possibly be any animal       known to science  they all agreed that it was a huge creature        luminous  ghastly  and spectral  i have cross examined these men        one of them a hard headed countryman  one a farrier  and one a       moorland farmer  who all tell the same story of this dreadful       apparition  exactly corresponding to the hell hound of the       legend  i assure you that there is a reign of terror in the       district  and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at       night           and you  a trained man of science  believe it to be       supernatural           i do not know what to believe          holmes shrugged his shoulders   i have hitherto confined my       investigations to this world   said he   in a modest way i have       combated evil  but to take on the father of evil himself would        perhaps  be too ambitious a task  yet you must admit that the       footmark is material           the original hound was material enough to tug a man s throat       out  and yet he was diabolical as well           i see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists  but       now  dr  mortimer  tell me this  if you hold these views  why       have you come to consult me at all  you tell me in the same       breath that it is useless to investigate sir charles s death  and       that you desire me to do it           i did not say that i desired you to do it           then  how can i assist you           by advising me as to what i should do with sir henry       baskerville  who arrives at waterloo station  dr  mortimer looked       at his watch  in exactly one hour and a quarter           he being the heir           yes  on the death of sir charles we inquired for this young       gentleman and found that he had been farming in canada  from the       accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every       way  i speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and       executor of sir charles s will           there is no other claimant  i presume           none  the only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was       rodger baskerville  the youngest of three brothers of whom poor       sir charles was the elder  the second brother  who died young  is       the father of this lad henry  the third  rodger  was the black       sheep of the family  he came of the old masterful baskerville       strain and was the very image  they tell me  of the family       picture of old hugo  he made england too hot to hold him  fled to       central america  and died there in      of yellow fever  henry is       the last of the baskervilles  in one hour and five minutes i meet       him at waterloo station  i have had a wire that he arrived at       southampton this morning  now  mr  holmes  what would you advise       me to do with him           why should he not go to the home of his fathers           it seems natural  does it not  and yet  consider that every       baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate  i feel sure       that if sir charles could have spoken with me before his death he       would have warned me against bringing this  the last of the old       race  and the heir to great wealth  to that deadly place  and yet       it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor  bleak       countryside depends upon his presence  all the good work which       has been done by sir charles will crash to the ground if there is       no tenant of the hall  i fear lest i should be swayed too much by       my own obvious interest in the matter  and that is why i bring       the case before you and ask for your advice          holmes considered for a little time          put into plain words  the matter is this   said he   in your       opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes dartmoor an       unsafe abode for a baskerville that is your opinion           at least i might go the length of saying that there is some       evidence that this may be so           exactly  but surely  if your supernatural theory be correct  it       could work the young man evil in london as easily as in       devonshire  a devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry       would be too inconceivable a thing           you put the matter more flippantly  mr  holmes  than you would       probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these       things  your advice  then  as i understand it  is that the young       man will be as safe in devonshire as in london  he comes in fifty       minutes  what would you recommend           i recommend  sir  that you take a cab  call off your spaniel who       is scratching at my front door  and proceed to waterloo to meet       sir henry baskerville           and then           and then you will say nothing to him at all until i have made up       my mind about the matter           how long will it take you to make up your mind           twenty four hours  at ten o clock tomorrow  dr  mortimer  i will       be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here  and it will       be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring sir       henry baskerville with you           i will do so  mr  holmes   he scribbled the appointment on his       shirt cuff and hurried off in his strange  peering  absent minded       fashion  holmes stopped him at the head of the stair          only one more question  dr  mortimer  you say that before sir       charles baskerville s death several people saw this apparition       upon the moor           three people did           did any see it after           i have not heard of any           thank you  good morning          holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward       satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him          going out  watson           unless i can help you           no  my dear fellow  it is at the hour of action that i turn to       you for aid  but this is splendid  really unique from some points       of view  when you pass bradley s  would you ask him to send up a       pound of the strongest shag tobacco  thank you  it would be as       well if you could make it convenient not to return before       evening  then i should be very glad to compare impressions as to       this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this       morning          i knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my       friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during       which he weighed every particle of evidence  constructed       alternative theories  balanced one against the other  and made up       his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial        i therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to baker       street until evening  it was nearly nine o clock when i found       myself in the sitting room once more         my first impression as i opened the door was that a fire had       broken out  for the room was so filled with smoke that the light       of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it  as i entered        however  my fears were set at rest  for it was the acrid fumes of       strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me       coughing  through the haze i had a vague vision of holmes in his       dressing gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe       between his lips  several rolls of paper lay around him          caught cold  watson   said he          no  it s this poisonous atmosphere           i suppose it  is  pretty thick  now that you mention it           thick  it is intolerable           open the window  then  you have been at your club all day  i       perceive           my dear holmes           am i right           certainly  but how          he laughed at my bewildered expression   there is a delightful       freshness about you  watson  which makes it a pleasure to       exercise any small powers which i possess at your expense  a       gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day  he returns       immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his       boots  he has been a fixture therefore all day  he is not a man       with intimate friends  where  then  could he have been  is it not       obvious           well  it is rather obvious           the world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance       ever observes  where do you think that i have been           a fixture also           on the contrary  i have been to devonshire           in spirit           exactly  my body has remained in this armchair and has  i regret       to observe  consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and       an incredible amount of tobacco  after you left i sent down to       stamford s for the ordnance map of this portion of the moor  and       my spirit has hovered over it all day  i flatter myself that i       could find my way about           a large scale map  i presume           very large          he unrolled one section and held it over his knee   here you have       the particular district which concerns us  that is baskerville       hall in the middle           with a wood round it           exactly  i fancy the yew alley  though not marked under that       name  must stretch along this line  with the moor  as you       perceive  upon the right of it  this small clump of buildings       here is the hamlet of grimpen  where our friend dr  mortimer has       his headquarters  within a radius of five miles there are  as you       see  only a very few scattered dwellings  here is lafter hall        which was mentioned in the narrative  there is a house indicated       here which may be the residence of the naturalist stapleton  if i       remember right  was his name  here are two moorland farmhouses        high tor and foulmire  then fourteen miles away the great convict       prison of princetown  between and around these scattered points       extends the desolate  lifeless moor  this  then  is the stage       upon which tragedy has been played  and upon which we may help to       play it again           it must be a wild place           yes  the setting is a worthy one  if the devil did desire to       have a hand in the affairs of men           then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural       explanation           the devil s agents may be of flesh and blood  may they not        there are two questions waiting for us at the outset  the one is       whether any crime has been committed at all  the second is  what       is the crime and how was it committed  of course  if dr        mortimer s surmise should be correct  and we are dealing with       forces outside the ordinary laws of nature  there is an end of       our investigation  but we are bound to exhaust all other       hypotheses before falling back upon this one  i think we ll shut       that window again  if you don t mind  it is a singular thing  but       i find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of       thought  i have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box       to think  but that is the logical outcome of my convictions  have       you turned the case over in your mind           yes  i have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day           what do you make of it           it is very bewildering           it has certainly a character of its own  there are points of       distinction about it  that change in the footprints  for example        what do you make of that           mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that       portion of the alley           he only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest  why       should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley           what then           he was running  watson running desperately  running for his       life  running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his       face           running from what           there lies our problem  there are indications that the man was       crazed with fear before ever he began to run           how can you say that           i am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across       the moor  if that were so  and it seems most probable  only a man       who had lost his wits would have run  from  the house instead of       towards it  if the gipsy s evidence may be taken as true  he ran       with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely       to be  then  again  whom was he waiting for that night  and why       was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own       house           you think that he was waiting for someone           the man was elderly and infirm  we can understand his taking an       evening stroll  but the ground was damp and the night inclement        is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes  as       dr  mortimer  with more practical sense than i should have given       him credit for  deduced from the cigar ash           but he went out every evening           i think it unlikely that he waited at the moor gate every       evening  on the contrary  the evidence is that he avoided the       moor  that night he waited there  it was the night before he made       his departure for london  the thing takes shape  watson  it       becomes coherent  might i ask you to hand me my violin  and we       will postpone all further thought upon this business until we       have had the advantage of meeting dr  mortimer and sir henry       baskerville in the morning      chapter     sir henry baskerville        our breakfast table was cleared early  and holmes waited in his       dressing gown for the promised interview  our clients were       punctual to their appointment  for the clock had just struck ten       when dr  mortimer was shown up  followed by the young baronet        the latter was a small  alert  dark eyed man about thirty years       of age  very sturdily built  with thick black eyebrows and a       strong  pugnacious face  he wore a ruddy tinted tweed suit and       had the weather beaten appearance of one who has spent most of       his time in the open air  and yet there was something in his       steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated       the gentleman          this is sir henry baskerville   said dr  mortimer          why  yes   said he   and the strange thing is  mr  sherlock       holmes  that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to       you this morning i should have come on my own account  i       understand that you think out little puzzles  and i ve had one       this morning which wants more thinking out than i am able to give       it           pray take a seat  sir henry  do i understand you to say that you       have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in       london           nothing of much importance  mr  holmes  only a joke  as like as       not  it was this letter  if you can call it a letter  which       reached me this morning          he laid an envelope upon the table  and we all bent over it  it       was of common quality  greyish in colour  the address   sir henry       baskerville  northumberland hotel   was printed in rough       characters  the post mark  charing cross   and the date of       posting the preceding evening          who knew that you were going to the northumberland hotel   asked       holmes  glancing keenly across at our visitor          no one could have known  we only decided after i met dr        mortimer           but dr  mortimer was no doubt already stopping there           no  i had been staying with a friend   said the doctor          there was no possible indication that we intended to go to this       hotel           hum  someone seems to be very deeply interested in your       movements   out of the envelope he took a half sheet of foolscap       paper folded into four  this he opened and spread flat upon the       table  across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed       by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it  it ran           as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor         the word  moor  only was printed in ink          now   said sir henry baskerville   perhaps you will tell me  mr        holmes  what in thunder is the meaning of that  and who it is       that takes so much interest in my affairs           what do you make of it  dr  mortimer  you must allow that there       is nothing supernatural about this  at any rate           no  sir  but it might very well come from someone who was       convinced that the business is supernatural           what business   asked sir henry sharply   it seems to me that       all you gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own       affairs           you shall share our knowledge before you leave this room  sir       henry  i promise you that   said sherlock holmes   we will       confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this       very interesting document  which must have been put together and       posted yesterday evening  have you yesterday s  times   watson           it is here in the corner           might i trouble you for it the inside page  please  with the       leading articles   he glanced swiftly over it  running his eyes       up and down the columns   capital article this on free trade        permit me to give you an extract from it         you may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or      your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff  but      it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run      keep away wealth from the country  diminish the value of our      imports  and lower the general conditions of life in this island           what do you think of that  watson   cried holmes in high glee        rubbing his hands together with satisfaction   don t you think       that is an admirable sentiment          dr  mortimer looked at holmes with an air of professional       interest  and sir henry baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark       eyes upon me          i don t know much about the tariff and things of that kind         said he   but it seems to me we ve got a bit off the trail so far       as that note is concerned           on the contrary  i think we are particularly hot upon the trail        sir henry  watson here knows more about my methods than you do        but i fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of       this sentence           no  i confess that i see no connection           and yet  my dear watson  there is so very close a connection       that the one is extracted out of the other   you    your          your    life    reason    value    keep away    from the   don t       you see now whence these words have been taken           by thunder  you re right  well  if that isn t smart   cried sir       henry          if any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that        keep away  and  from the  are cut out in one piece           well  now so it is           really  mr  holmes  this exceeds anything which i could have       imagined   said dr  mortimer  gazing at my friend in amazement         i could understand anyone saying that the words were from a       newspaper  but that you should name which  and add that it came       from the leading article  is really one of the most remarkable       things which i have ever known  how did you do it           i presume  doctor  that you could tell the skull of a negro from       that of an esquimau           most certainly           but how           because that is my special hobby  the differences are obvious        the supra orbital crest  the facial angle  the maxillary curve        the           but this is my special hobby  and the differences are equally       obvious  there is as much difference to my eyes between the       leaded bourgeois type of a  times  article and the slovenly print       of an evening half penny paper as there could be between your       negro and your esquimau  the detection of types is one of the       most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in       crime  though i confess that once when i was very young i       confused the  leeds mercury  with the  western morning news   but       a  times  leader is entirely distinctive  and these words could       have been taken from nothing else  as it was done yesterday the       strong probability was that we should find the words in       yesterday s issue           so far as i can follow you  then  mr  holmes   said sir henry       baskerville   someone cut out this message with a scissors           nail scissors   said holmes   you can see that it was a very       short bladed scissors  since the cutter had to take two snips       over  keep away            that is so  someone  then  cut out the message with a pair of       short bladed scissors  pasted it with paste           gum   said holmes          with gum on to the paper  but i want to know why the word  moor        should have been written           because he could not find it in print  the other words were all       simple and might be found in any issue  but  moor  would be less       common           why  of course  that would explain it  have you read anything       else in this message  mr  holmes           there are one or two indications  and yet the utmost pains have       been taken to remove all clues  the address  you observe is       printed in rough characters  but the  times  is a paper which is       seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated  we       may take it  therefore  that the letter was composed by an       educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one  and his       effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing       might be known  or come to be known  by you  again  you will       observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line  but       that some are much higher than others   life   for example is       quite out of its proper place  that may point to carelessness or       it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter        on the whole i incline to the latter view  since the matter was       evidently important  and it is unlikely that the composer of such       a letter would be careless  if he were in a hurry it opens up the       interesting question why he should be in a hurry  since any       letter posted up to early morning would reach sir henry before he       would leave his hotel  did the composer fear an interruption and       from whom           we are coming now rather into the region of guesswork   said dr        mortimer          say  rather  into the region where we balance probabilities and       choose the most likely  it is the scientific use of the       imagination  but we have always some material basis on which to       start our speculation  now  you would call it a guess  no doubt        but i am almost certain that this address has been written in a       hotel           how in the world can you say that           if you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and       the ink have given the writer trouble  the pen has spluttered       twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short       address  showing that there was very little ink in the bottle        now  a private pen or ink bottle is seldom allowed to be in such       a state  and the combination of the two must be quite rare  but       you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen  where it is rare to get       anything else  yes  i have very little hesitation in saying that       could we examine the waste paper baskets of the hotels around       charing cross until we found the remains of the mutilated  times        leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent       this singular message  halloa  halloa  what s this          he was carefully examining the foolscap  upon which the words       were pasted  holding it only an inch or two from his eyes          well           nothing   said he  throwing it down   it is a blank half sheet       of paper  without even a water mark upon it  i think we have       drawn as much as we can from this curious letter  and now  sir       henry  has anything else of interest happened to you since you       have been in london           why  no  mr  holmes  i think not           you have not observed anyone follow or watch you           i seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel         said our visitor   why in thunder should anyone follow or watch       me           we are coming to that  you have nothing else to report to us       before we go into this matter           well  it depends upon what you think worth reporting           i think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth       reporting          sir henry smiled   i don t know much of british life yet  for i       have spent nearly all my time in the states and in canada  but i       hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary       routine of life over here           you have lost one of your boots           my dear sir   cried dr  mortimer   it is only mislaid  you will       find it when you return to the hotel  what is the use of       troubling mr  holmes with trifles of this kind           well  he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine           exactly   said holmes   however foolish the incident may seem        you have lost one of your boots  you say           well  mislaid it  anyhow  i put them both outside my door last       night  and there was only one in the morning  i could get no       sense out of the chap who cleans them  the worst of it is that i       only bought the pair last night in the strand  and i have never       had them on           if you have never worn them  why did you put them out to be       cleaned           they were tan boots and had never been varnished  that was why i       put them out           then i understand that on your arrival in london yesterday you       went out at once and bought a pair of boots           i did a good deal of shopping  dr  mortimer here went round with       me  you see  if i am to be squire down there i must dress the       part  and it may be that i have got a little careless in my ways       out west  among other things i bought these brown boots gave six       dollars for them and had one stolen before ever i had them on my       feet           it seems a singularly useless thing to steal   said sherlock       holmes   i confess that i share dr  mortimer s belief that it       will not be long before the missing boot is found           and  now  gentlemen   said the baronet with decision   it seems       to me that i have spoken quite enough about the little that i       know  it is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full       account of what we are all driving at           your request is a very reasonable one   holmes answered   dr        mortimer  i think you could not do better than to tell your story       as you told it to us          thus encouraged  our scientific friend drew his papers from his       pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the       morning before  sir henry baskerville listened with the deepest       attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise          well  i seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance         said he when the long narrative was finished   of course  i ve       heard of the hound ever since i was in the nursery  it s the pet       story of the family  though i never thought of taking it       seriously before  but as to my uncle s death well  it all seems       boiling up in my head  and i can t get it clear yet  you don t       seem quite to have made up your mind whether it s a case for a       policeman or a clergyman           precisely           and now there s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel  i       suppose that fits into its place           it seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what       goes on upon the moor   said dr  mortimer          and also   said holmes   that someone is not ill disposed       towards you  since they warn you of danger           or it may be that they wish  for their own purposes  to scare me       away           well  of course  that is possible also  i am very much indebted       to you  dr  mortimer  for introducing me to a problem which       presents several interesting alternatives  but the practical       point which we now have to decide  sir henry  is whether it is or       is not advisable for you to go to baskerville hall           why should i not go           there seems to be danger           do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger       from human beings           well  that is what we have to find out           whichever it is  my answer is fixed  there is no devil in hell        mr  holmes  and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me       from going to the home of my own people  and you may take that to       be my final answer   his dark brows knitted and his face flushed       to a dusky red as he spoke  it was evident that the fiery temper       of the baskervilles was not extinct in this their last       representative   meanwhile   said he   i have hardly had time to       think over all that you have told me  it s a big thing for a man       to have to understand and to decide at one sitting  i should like       to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind  now  look       here  mr  holmes  it s half past eleven now and i am going back       right away to my hotel  suppose you and your friend  dr  watson        come round and lunch with us at two  i ll be able to tell you       more clearly then how this thing strikes me           is that convenient to you  watson           perfectly           then you may expect us  shall i have a cab called           i d prefer to walk  for this affair has flurried me rather           i ll join you in a walk  with pleasure   said his companion          then we meet again at two o clock  au revoir  and good morning          we heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang       of the front door  in an instant holmes had changed from the       languid dreamer to the man of action          your hat and boots  watson  quick  not a moment to lose   he       rushed into his room in his dressing gown and was back again in a       few seconds in a frock coat  we hurried together down the stairs       and into the street  dr  mortimer and baskerville were still       visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of       oxford street          shall i run on and stop them           not for the world  my dear watson  i am perfectly satisfied with       your company if you will tolerate mine  our friends are wise  for       it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk          he quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which       divided us by about half  then  still keeping a hundred yards       behind  we followed into oxford street and so down regent street        once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window  upon       which holmes did the same  an instant afterwards he gave a little       cry of satisfaction  and  following the direction of his eager       eyes  i saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted       on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward       again          there s our man  watson  come along  we ll have a good look at       him  if we can do no more          at that instant i was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of       piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab        instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up  something was screamed       to the driver  and the cab flew madly off down regent street        holmes looked eagerly round for another  but no empty one was in       sight  then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the       traffic  but the start was too great  and already the cab was out       of sight          there now   said holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white       with vexation from the tide of vehicles   was ever such bad luck       and such bad management  too  watson  watson  if you are an       honest man you will record this also and set it against my       successes           who was the man           i have not an idea           a spy           well  it was evident from what we have heard that baskerville       has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in       town  how else could it be known so quickly that it was the       northumberland hotel which he had chosen  if they had followed       him the first day i argued that they would follow him also the       second  you may have observed that i twice strolled over to the       window while dr  mortimer was reading his legend           yes  i remember           i was looking out for loiterers in the street  but i saw none        we are dealing with a clever man  watson  this matter cuts very       deep  and though i have not finally made up my mind whether it is       a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us  i       am conscious always of power and design  when our friends left i       at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their       invisible attendant  so wily was he that he had not trusted       himself upon foot  but he had availed himself of a cab so that he       could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice        his method had the additional advantage that if they were to take       a cab he was all ready to follow them  it has  however  one       obvious disadvantage           it puts him in the power of the cabman           exactly           what a pity we did not get the number           my dear watson  clumsy as i have been  you surely do not       seriously imagine that i neglected to get the number  no       is       our man  but that is no use to us for the moment           i fail to see how you could have done more           on observing the cab i should have instantly turned and walked       in the other direction  i should then at my leisure have hired a       second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance  or        better still  have driven to the northumberland hotel and waited       there  when our unknown had followed baskerville home we should       have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and       seeing where he made for  as it is  by an indiscreet eagerness        which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and       energy by our opponent  we have betrayed ourselves and lost our       man          we had been sauntering slowly down regent street during this       conversation  and dr  mortimer  with his companion  had long       vanished in front of us          there is no object in our following them   said holmes   the       shadow has departed and will not return  we must see what further       cards we have in our hands and play them with decision  could you       swear to that man s face within the cab           i could swear only to the beard           and so could i from which i gather that in all probability it       was a false one  a clever man upon so delicate an errand has no       use for a beard save to conceal his features  come in here        watson          he turned into one of the district messenger offices  where he       was warmly greeted by the manager          ah  wilson  i see you have not forgotten the little case in       which i had the good fortune to help you           no  sir  indeed i have not  you saved my good name  and perhaps       my life           my dear fellow  you exaggerate  i have some recollection        wilson  that you had among your boys a lad named cartwright  who       showed some ability during the investigation           yes  sir  he is still with us           could you ring him up  thank you  and i should be glad to have       change of this five pound note          a lad of fourteen  with a bright  keen face  had obeyed the       summons of the manager  he stood now gazing with great reverence       at the famous detective          let me have the hotel directory   said holmes   thank you  now        cartwright  there are the names of twenty three hotels here  all       in the immediate neighbourhood of charing cross  do you see           yes  sir           you will visit each of these in turn           yes  sir           you will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one       shilling  here are twenty three shillings           yes  sir           you will tell him that you want to see the waste paper of       yesterday  you will say that an important telegram has miscarried       and that you are looking for it  you understand           yes  sir           but what you are really looking for is the centre page of the        times  with some holes cut in it with scissors  here is a copy       of the  times   it is this page  you could easily recognize it        could you not           yes  sir           in each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter        to whom also you will give a shilling  here are twenty three       shillings  you will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of       the twenty three that the waste of the day before has been burned       or removed  in the three other cases you will be shown a heap of       paper and you will look for this page of the  times  among it        the odds are enormously against your finding it  there are ten       shillings over in case of emergencies  let me have a report by       wire at baker street before evening  and now  watson  it only       remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman        no        and then we will drop into one of the bond street       picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the       hotel      chapter     three broken threads        sherlock holmes had  in a very remarkable degree  the power of       detaching his mind at will  for two hours the strange business in       which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten  and he was       entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern belgian masters        he would talk of nothing but art  of which he had the crudest       ideas  from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at       the northumberland hotel          sir henry baskerville is upstairs expecting you   said the       clerk   he asked me to show you up at once when you came           have you any objection to my looking at your register   said       holmes          not in the least          the book showed that two names had been added after that of       baskerville  one was theophilus johnson and family  of newcastle        the other mrs  oldmore and maid  of high lodge  alton          surely that must be the same johnson whom i used to know   said       holmes to the porter   a lawyer  is he not  grey headed  and       walks with a limp           no  sir  this is mr  johnson  the coal owner  a very active       gentleman  not older than yourself           surely you are mistaken about his trade           no  sir  he has used this hotel for many years  and he is very       well known to us           ah  that settles it  mrs  oldmore  too  i seem to remember the       name  excuse my curiosity  but often in calling upon one friend       one finds another           she is an invalid lady  sir  her husband was once mayor of       gloucester  she always comes to us when she is in town           thank you  i am afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance  we have       established a most important fact by these questions  watson   he       continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together   we know       now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not       settled down in his own hotel  that means that while they are  as       we have seen  very anxious to watch him  they are equally anxious       that he should not see them  now  this is a most suggestive       fact           what does it suggest           it suggests halloa  my dear fellow  what on earth is the       matter          as we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against sir       henry baskerville himself  his face was flushed with anger  and       he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands  so furious was       he that he was hardly articulate  and when he did speak it was in       a much broader and more western dialect than any which we had       heard from him in the morning          seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel   he       cried   they ll find they ve started in to monkey with the wrong       man unless they are careful  by thunder  if that chap can t find       my missing boot there will be trouble  i can take a joke with the       best  mr  holmes  but they ve got a bit over the mark this time           still looking for your boot           yes  sir  and mean to find it           but  surely  you said that it was a new brown boot           so it was  sir  and now it s an old black one           what  you don t mean to say            that s just what i do mean to say  i only had three pairs in the       world the new brown  the old black  and the patent leathers        which i am wearing  last night they took one of my brown ones        and today they have sneaked one of the black  well  have you got       it  speak out  man  and don t stand staring          an agitated german waiter had appeared upon the scene          no  sir  i have made inquiry all over the hotel  but i can hear       no word of it           well  either that boot comes back before sundown or i ll see the       manager and tell him that i go right straight out of this hotel           it shall be found  sir i promise you that if you will have a       little patience it will be found           mind it is  for it s the last thing of mine that i ll lose in       this den of thieves  well  well  mr  holmes  you ll excuse my       troubling you about such a trifle           i think it s well worth troubling about           why  you look very serious over it           how do you explain it           i just don t attempt to explain it  it seems the very maddest        queerest thing that ever happened to me           the queerest perhaps   said holmes thoughtfully          what do you make of it yourself           well  i don t profess to understand it yet  this case of yours       is very complex  sir henry  when taken in conjunction with your       uncle s death i am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of       capital importance which i have handled there is one which cuts       so deep  but we hold several threads in our hands  and the odds       are that one or other of them guides us to the truth  we may       waste time in following the wrong one  but sooner or later we       must come upon the right          we had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the       business which had brought us together  it was in the private       sitting room to which we afterwards repaired that holmes asked       baskerville what were his intentions          to go to baskerville hall           and when           at the end of the week           on the whole   said holmes   i think that your decision is a       wise one  i have ample evidence that you are being dogged in       london  and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult       to discover who these people are or what their object can be  if       their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief  and we       should be powerless to prevent it  you did not know  dr        mortimer  that you were followed this morning from my house          dr  mortimer started violently   followed  by whom           that  unfortunately  is what i cannot tell you  have you among       your neighbours or acquaintances on dartmoor any man with a       black  full beard           no or  let me see why  yes  barrymore  sir charles s butler  is       a man with a full  black beard           ha  where is barrymore           he is in charge of the hall           we had best ascertain if he is really there  or if by any       possibility he might be in london           how can you do that           give me a telegraph form   is all ready for sir henry   that       will do  address to mr  barrymore  baskerville hall  what is the       nearest telegraph office  grimpen  very good  we will send a       second wire to the postmaster  grimpen   telegram to mr        barrymore to be delivered into his own hand  if absent  please       return wire to sir henry baskerville  northumberland hotel   that       should let us know before evening whether barrymore is at his       post in devonshire or not           that s so   said baskerville   by the way  dr  mortimer  who is       this barrymore  anyhow           he is the son of the old caretaker  who is dead  they have       looked after the hall for four generations now  so far as i know        he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the       county           at the same time   said baskerville   it s clear enough that so       long as there are none of the family at the hall these people       have a mighty fine home and nothing to do           that is true           did barrymore profit at all by sir charles s will   asked       holmes          he and his wife had five hundred pounds each           ha  did they know that they would receive this           yes  sir charles was very fond of talking about the provisions       of his will           that is very interesting           i hope   said dr  mortimer   that you do not look with       suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from sir       charles  for i also had a thousand pounds left to me           indeed  and anyone else           there were many insignificant sums to individuals  and a large       number of public charities  the residue all went to sir henry           and how much was the residue           seven hundred and forty thousand pounds          holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise   i had no idea that so       gigantic a sum was involved   said he          sir charles had the reputation of being rich  but we did not       know how very rich he was until we came to examine his       securities  the total value of the estate was close on to a       million           dear me  it is a stake for which a man might well play a       desperate game  and one more question  dr  mortimer  supposing       that anything happened to our young friend here you will forgive       the unpleasant hypothesis  who would inherit the estate           since rodger baskerville  sir charles s younger brother died       unmarried  the estate would descend to the desmonds  who are       distant cousins  james desmond is an elderly clergyman in       westmoreland           thank you  these details are all of great interest  have you met       mr  james desmond           yes  he once came down to visit sir charles  he is a man of       venerable appearance and of saintly life  i remember that he       refused to accept any settlement from sir charles  though he       pressed it upon him           and this man of simple tastes would be the heir to sir charles s       thousands           he would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed  he       would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed       otherwise by the present owner  who can  of course  do what he       likes with it           and have you made your will  sir henry           no  mr  holmes  i have not  i ve had no time  for it was only       yesterday that i learned how matters stood  but in any case i       feel that the money should go with the title and estate  that was       my poor uncle s idea  how is the owner going to restore the       glories of the baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up       the property  house  land  and dollars must go together           quite so  well  sir henry  i am of one mind with you as to the       advisability of your going down to devonshire without delay        there is only one provision which i must make  you certainly must       not go alone           dr  mortimer returns with me           but dr  mortimer has his practice to attend to  and his house is       miles away from yours  with all the goodwill in the world he may       be unable to help you  no  sir henry  you must take with you       someone  a trusty man  who will be always by your side           is it possible that you could come yourself  mr  holmes           if matters came to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in       person  but you can understand that  with my extensive consulting       practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many       quarters  it is impossible for me to be absent from london for an       indefinite time  at the present instant one of the most revered       names in england is being besmirched by a blackmailer  and only i       can stop a disastrous scandal  you will see how impossible it is       for me to go to dartmoor           whom would you recommend  then          holmes laid his hand upon my arm   if my friend would undertake       it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when       you are in a tight place  no one can say so more confidently than       i          the proposition took me completely by surprise  but before i had       time to answer  baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it       heartily          well  now  that is real kind of you  dr  watson   said he   you       see how it is with me  and you know just as much about the matter       as i do  if you will come down to baskerville hall and see me       through i ll never forget it          the promise of adventure had always a fascination for me  and i       was complimented by the words of holmes and by the eagerness with       which the baronet hailed me as a companion          i will come  with pleasure   said i   i do not know how i could       employ my time better           and you will report very carefully to me   said holmes   when a       crisis comes  as it will do  i will direct how you shall act  i       suppose that by saturday all might be ready           would that suit dr  watson           perfectly           then on saturday  unless you hear to the contrary  we shall meet       at the ten thirty train from paddington          we had risen to depart when baskerville gave a cry of triumph        and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown       boot from under a cabinet          my missing boot   he cried          may all our difficulties vanish as easily   said sherlock       holmes          but it is a very singular thing   dr  mortimer remarked   i       searched this room carefully before lunch           and so did i   said baskerville   every inch of it           there was certainly no boot in it then           in that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were       lunching          the german was sent for but professed to know nothing of the       matter  nor could any inquiry clear it up  another item had been       added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small       mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly  setting       aside the whole grim story of sir charles s death  we had a line       of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days        which included the receipt of the printed letter  the       black bearded spy in the hansom  the loss of the new brown boot        the loss of the old black boot  and now the return of the new       brown boot  holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to       baker street  and i knew from his drawn brows and keen face that       his mind  like my own  was busy in endeavouring to frame some       scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected       episodes could be fitted  all afternoon and late into the evening       he sat lost in tobacco and thought         just before dinner two telegrams were handed in  the first ran         have just heard that barrymore is at the hall  baskerville         the second         visited twenty three hotels as directed  but sorry to report       unable to trace cut sheet of  times   cartwright          there go two of my threads  watson  there is nothing more       stimulating than a case where everything goes against you  we       must cast round for another scent           we have still the cabman who drove the spy           exactly  i have wired to get his name and address from the       official registry  i should not be surprised if this were an       answer to my question          the ring at the bell proved to be something even more       satisfactory than an answer  however  for the door opened and a       rough looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself          i got a message from the head office that a gent at this address       had been inquiring for no         said he   i ve driven my cab       this seven years and never a word of complaint  i came here       straight from the yard to ask you to your face what you had       against me           i have nothing in the world against you  my good man   said       holmes   on the contrary  i have half a sovereign for you if you       will give me a clear answer to my questions           well  i ve had a good day and no mistake   said the cabman with       a grin   what was it you wanted to ask  sir           first of all your name and address  in case i want you again           john clayton    turpey street  the borough  my cab is out of       shipley s yard  near waterloo station          sherlock holmes made a note of it          now  clayton  tell me all about the fare who came and watched       this house at ten o clock this morning and afterwards followed       the two gentlemen down regent street          the man looked surprised and a little embarrassed   why  there s       no good my telling you things  for you seem to know as much as i       do already   said he   the truth is that the gentleman told me       that he was a detective and that i was to say nothing about him       to anyone           my good fellow  this is a very serious business  and you may       find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide       anything from me  you say that your fare told you that he was a       detective           yes  he did           when did he say this           when he left me           did he say anything more           he mentioned his name          holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me   oh  he mentioned       his name  did he  that was imprudent  what was the name that he       mentioned           his name   said the cabman   was mr  sherlock holmes          never have i seen my friend more completely taken aback than by       the cabman s reply  for an instant he sat in silent amazement        then he burst into a hearty laugh          a touch  watson an undeniable touch   said he   i feel a foil as       quick and supple as my own  he got home upon me very prettily       that time  so his name was sherlock holmes  was it           yes  sir  that was the gentleman s name           excellent  tell me where you picked him up and all that       occurred           he hailed me at half past nine in trafalgar square  he said that       he was a detective  and he offered me two guineas if i would do       exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions  i was glad       enough to agree  first we drove down to the northumberland hotel       and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from       the rank  we followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near       here           this very door   said holmes          well  i couldn t be sure of that  but i dare say my fare knew       all about it  we pulled up halfway down the street and waited an       hour and a half  then the two gentlemen passed us  walking  and       we followed down baker street and along           i know   said holmes          until we got three quarters down regent street  then my       gentleman threw up the trap  and he cried that i should drive       right away to waterloo station as hard as i could go  i whipped       up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes  then he paid       up his two guineas  like a good one  and away he went into the       station  only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said         it might interest you to know that you have been driving mr        sherlock holmes   that s how i come to know the name           i see  and you saw no more of him           not after he went into the station           and how would you describe mr  sherlock holmes          the cabman scratched his head   well  he wasn t altogether such       an easy gentleman to describe  i d put him at forty years of age        and he was of a middle height  two or three inches shorter than       you  sir  he was dressed like a toff  and he had a black beard        cut square at the end  and a pale face  i don t know as i could       say more than that           colour of his eyes           no  i can t say that           nothing more that you can remember           no  sir  nothing           well  then  here is your half sovereign  there s another one       waiting for you if you can bring any more information        good night           good night  sir  and thank you          john clayton departed chuckling  and holmes turned to me with a       shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile          snap goes our third thread  and we end where we began   said he         the cunning rascal  he knew our number  knew that sir henry       baskerville had consulted me  spotted who i was in regent street        conjectured that i had got the number of the cab and would lay my       hands on the driver  and so sent back this audacious message  i       tell you  watson  this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of       our steel  i ve been checkmated in london  i can only wish you       better luck in devonshire  but i m not easy in my mind about it           about what           about sending you  it s an ugly business  watson  an ugly       dangerous business  and the more i see of it the less i like it        yes  my dear fellow  you may laugh  but i give you my word that i       shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in baker       street once more      chapter     baskerville hall        sir henry baskerville and dr  mortimer were ready upon the       appointed day  and we started as arranged for devonshire  mr        sherlock holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last       parting injunctions and advice          i will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions        watson   said he   i wish you simply to report facts in the       fullest possible manner to me  and you can leave me to do the       theorizing           what sort of facts   i asked          anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon       the case  and especially the relations between young baskerville       and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death       of sir charles  i have made some inquiries myself in the last few       days  but the results have  i fear  been negative  one thing only       appears to be certain  and that is that mr  james desmond  who is       the next heir  is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable       disposition  so that this persecution does not arise from him  i       really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our       calculations  there remain the people who will actually surround       sir henry baskerville upon the moor           would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this       barrymore couple           by no means  you could not make a greater mistake  if they are       innocent it would be a cruel injustice  and if they are guilty we       should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them  no        no  we will preserve them upon our list of suspects  then there       is a groom at the hall  if i remember right  there are two       moorland farmers  there is our friend dr  mortimer  whom i       believe to be entirely honest  and there is his wife  of whom we       know nothing  there is this naturalist  stapleton  and there is       his sister  who is said to be a young lady of attractions  there       is mr  frankland  of lafter hall  who is also an unknown factor        and there are one or two other neighbours  these are the folk who       must be your very special study           i will do my best           you have arms  i suppose           yes  i thought it as well to take them           most certainly  keep your revolver near you night and day  and       never relax your precautions          our friends had already secured a first class carriage and were       waiting for us upon the platform          no  we have no news of any kind   said dr  mortimer in answer to       my friend s questions   i can swear to one thing  and that is       that we have not been shadowed during the last two days  we have       never gone out without keeping a sharp watch  and no one could       have escaped our notice           you have always kept together  i presume           except yesterday afternoon  i usually give up one day to pure       amusement when i come to town  so i spent it at the museum of the       college of surgeons           and i went to look at the folk in the park   said baskerville          but we had no trouble of any kind           it was imprudent  all the same   said holmes  shaking his head       and looking very grave   i beg  sir henry  that you will not go       about alone  some great misfortune will befall you if you do  did       you get your other boot           no  sir  it is gone forever           indeed  that is very interesting  well  good bye   he added as       the train began to glide down the platform   bear in mind  sir       henry  one of the phrases in that queer old legend which dr        mortimer has read to us  and avoid the moor in those hours of       darkness when the powers of evil are exalted          i looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and       saw the tall  austere figure of holmes standing motionless and       gazing after us         the journey was a swift and pleasant one  and i spent it in       making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in       playing with dr  mortimer s spaniel  in a very few hours the       brown earth had become ruddy  the brick had changed to granite        and red cows grazed in well hedged fields where the lush grasses       and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer  if a damper        climate  young baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and       cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features       of the devon scenery          i ve been over a good part of the world since i left it  dr        watson   said he   but i have never seen a place to compare with       it           i never saw a devonshire man who did not swear by his county   i       remarked          it depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the       county   said dr  mortimer   a glance at our friend here reveals       the rounded head of the celt  which carries inside it the celtic       enthusiasm and power of attachment  poor sir charles s head was       of a very rare type  half gaelic  half ivernian in its       characteristics  but you were very young when you last saw       baskerville hall  were you not           i was a boy in my teens at the time of my father s death and had       never seen the hall  for he lived in a little cottage on the       south coast  thence i went straight to a friend in america  i       tell you it is all as new to me as it is to dr  watson  and i m       as keen as possible to see the moor           are you  then your wish is easily granted  for there is your       first sight of the moor   said dr  mortimer  pointing out of the       carriage window         over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood       there rose in the distance a grey  melancholy hill  with a       strange jagged summit  dim and vague in the distance  like some       fantastic landscape in a dream  baskerville sat for a long time        his eyes fixed upon it  and i read upon his eager face how much       it meant to him  this first sight of that strange spot where the       men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so       deep  there he sat  with his tweed suit and his american accent        in the corner of a prosaic railway carriage  and yet as i looked       at his dark and expressive face i felt more than ever how true a       descendant he was of that long line of high blooded  fiery  and       masterful men  there were pride  valour  and strength in his       thick brows  his sensitive nostrils  and his large hazel eyes  if       on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should       lie before us  this was at least a comrade for whom one might       venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely       share it         the train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all       descended  outside  beyond the low  white fence  a wagonette with       a pair of cobs was waiting  our coming was evidently a great       event  for station master and porters clustered round us to carry       out our luggage  it was a sweet  simple country spot  but i was       surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly       men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and       glanced keenly at us as we passed  the coachman  a hard faced        gnarled little fellow  saluted sir henry baskerville  and in a       few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad  white road        rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us  and old       gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage  but       behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever  dark       against the evening sky  the long  gloomy curve of the moor        broken by the jagged and sinister hills         the wagonette swung round into a side road  and we curved upward       through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels  high banks on       either side  heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart s tongue       ferns  bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light       of the sinking sun  still steadily rising  we passed over a       narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed       swiftly down  foaming and roaring amid the grey boulders  both       road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak       and fir  at every turn baskerville gave an exclamation of       delight  looking eagerly about him and asking countless       questions  to his eyes all seemed beautiful  but to me a tinge of       melancholy lay upon the countryside  which bore so clearly the       mark of the waning year  yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and       fluttered down upon us as we passed  the rattle of our wheels       died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation sad       gifts  as it seemed to me  for nature to throw before the       carriage of the returning heir of the baskervilles          halloa   cried dr  mortimer   what is this          a steep curve of heath clad land  an outlying spur of the moor        lay in front of us  on the summit  hard and clear like an       equestrian statue upon its pedestal  was a mounted soldier  dark       and stern  his rifle poised ready over his forearm  he was       watching the road along which we travelled          what is this  perkins   asked dr  mortimer         our driver half turned in his seat   there s a convict escaped       from princetown  sir  he s been out three days now  and the       warders watch every road and every station  but they ve had no       sight of him yet  the farmers about here don t like it  sir  and       that s a fact           well  i understand that they get five pounds if they can give       information           yes  sir  but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing       compared to the chance of having your throat cut  you see  it       isn t like any ordinary convict  this is a man that would stick       at nothing           who is he  then           it is selden  the notting hill murderer          i remembered the case well  for it was one in which holmes had       taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the       crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions       of the assassin  the commutation of his death sentence had been       due to some doubts as to his complete sanity  so atrocious was       his conduct  our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us       rose the huge expanse of the moor  mottled with gnarled and       craggy cairns and tors  a cold wind swept down from it and set us       shivering  somewhere there  on that desolate plain  was lurking       this fiendish man  hiding in a burrow like a wild beast  his       heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast       him out  it needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness       of the barren waste  the chilling wind  and the darkling sky        even baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely       around him         we had left the fertile country behind and beneath us  we looked       back on it now  the slanting rays of a low sun turning the       streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new       turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands  the       road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and       olive slopes  sprinkled with giant boulders  now and then we       passed a moorland cottage  walled and roofed with stone  with no       creeper to break its harsh outline  suddenly we looked down into       a cuplike depression  patched with stunted oaks and firs which       had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm  two       high  narrow towers rose over the trees  the driver pointed with       his whip          baskerville hall   said he         its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and       shining eyes  a few minutes later we had reached the lodge gates        a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron  with weather bitten       pillars on either side  blotched with lichens  and surmounted by       the boars  heads of the baskervilles  the lodge was a ruin of       black granite and bared ribs of rafters  but facing it was a new       building  half constructed  the first fruit of sir charles s       south african gold         through the gateway we passed into the avenue  where the wheels       were again hushed amid the leaves  and the old trees shot their       branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads  baskerville shuddered       as he looked up the long  dark drive to where the house glimmered       like a ghost at the farther end          was it here   he asked in a low voice          no  no  the yew alley is on the other side          the young heir glanced round with a gloomy face          it s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in       such a place as this   said he   it s enough to scare any man        i ll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months        and you won t know it again  with a thousand candle power swan       and edison right here in front of the hall door          the avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf  and the house lay       before us  in the fading light i could see that the centre was a       heavy block of building from which a porch projected  the whole       front was draped in ivy  with a patch clipped bare here and there       where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil        from this central block rose the twin towers  ancient        crenelated  and pierced with many loopholes  to right and left of       the turrets were more modern wings of black granite  a dull light       shone through heavy mullioned windows  and from the high chimneys       which rose from the steep  high angled roof there sprang a single       black column of smoke          welcome  sir henry  welcome to baskerville hall          a tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the       door of the wagonette  the figure of a woman was silhouetted       against the yellow light of the hall  she came out and helped the       man to hand down our bags          you don t mind my driving straight home  sir henry   said dr        mortimer   my wife is expecting me           surely you will stay and have some dinner           no  i must go  i shall probably find some work awaiting me  i       would stay to show you over the house  but barrymore will be a       better guide than i  good bye  and never hesitate night or day to       send for me if i can be of service          the wheels died away down the drive while sir henry and i turned       into the hall  and the door clanged heavily behind us  it was a       fine apartment in which we found ourselves  large  lofty  and       heavily raftered with huge baulks of age blackened oak  in the       great old fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a       log fire crackled and snapped  sir henry and i held out our hands       to it  for we were numb from our long drive  then we gazed round       us at the high  thin window of old stained glass  the oak       panelling  the stags  heads  the coats of arms upon the walls        all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp          it s just as i imagined it   said sir henry   is it not the very       picture of an old family home  to think that this should be the       same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived        it strikes me solemn to think of it          i saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed       about him  the light beat upon him where he stood  but long       shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above       him  barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms        he stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a       well trained servant  he was a remarkable looking man  tall        handsome  with a square black beard and pale  distinguished       features          would you wish dinner to be served at once  sir           is it ready           in a very few minutes  sir  you will find hot water in your       rooms  my wife and i will be happy  sir henry  to stay with you       until you have made your fresh arrangements  but you will       understand that under the new conditions this house will require       a considerable staff           what new conditions           i only meant  sir  that sir charles led a very retired life  and       we were able to look after his wants  you would  naturally  wish       to have more company  and so you will need changes in your       household           do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave           only when it is quite convenient to you  sir           but your family have been with us for several generations  have       they not  i should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an       old family connection          i seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler s white       face          i feel that also  sir  and so does my wife  but to tell the       truth  sir  we were both very much attached to sir charles  and       his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very       painful to us  i fear that we shall never again be easy in our       minds at baskerville hall           but what do you intend to do           i have no doubt  sir  that we shall succeed in establishing       ourselves in some business  sir charles s generosity has given us       the means to do so  and now  sir  perhaps i had best show you to       your rooms          a square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall        approached by a double stair  from this central point two long       corridors extended the whole length of the building  from which       all the bedrooms opened  my own was in the same wing as       baskerville s and almost next door to it  these rooms appeared to       be much more modern than the central part of the house  and the       bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the       sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind         but the dining room which opened out of the hall was a place of       shadow and gloom  it was a long chamber with a step separating       the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for       their dependents  at one end a minstrel s gallery overlooked it        black beams shot across above our heads  with a smoke darkened       ceiling beyond them  with rows of flaring torches to light it up        and the colour and rude hilarity of an old time banquet  it might       have softened  but now  when two black clothed gentlemen sat in       the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp  one s voice       became hushed and one s spirit subdued  a dim line of ancestors        in every variety of dress  from the elizabethan knight to the       buck of the regency  stared down upon us and daunted us by their       silent company  we talked little  and i for one was glad when the       meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern       billiard room and smoke a cigarette          my word  it isn t a very cheerful place   said sir henry   i       suppose one can tone down to it  but i feel a bit out of the       picture at present  i don t wonder that my uncle got a little       jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this  however  if       it suits you  we will retire early tonight  and perhaps things       may seem more cheerful in the morning          i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from       my window  it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of       the hall door  beyond  two copses of trees moaned and swung in a       rising wind  a half moon broke through the rifts of racing       clouds  in its cold light i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe       of rocks  and the long  low curve of the melancholy moor  i       closed the curtain  feeling that my last impression was in       keeping with the rest         and yet it was not quite the last  i found myself weary and yet       wakeful  tossing restlessly from side to side  seeking for the       sleep which would not come  far away a chiming clock struck out       the quarters of the hours  but otherwise a deathly silence lay       upon the old house  and then suddenly  in the very dead of the       night  there came a sound to my ears  clear  resonant  and       unmistakable  it was the sob of a woman  the muffled  strangling       gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow  i sat up in       bed and listened intently  the noise could not have been far away       and was certainly in the house  for half an hour i waited with       every nerve on the alert  but there came no other sound save the       chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall     chapter     the stapletons of merripit house        the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface       from our minds the grim and grey impression which had been left       upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall  as       sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through       the high mullioned windows  throwing watery patches of colour       from the coats of arms which covered them  the dark panelling       glowed like bronze in the golden rays  and it was hard to realise       that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom       into our souls upon the evening before          i guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to       blame   said the baronet   we were tired with our journey and       chilled by our drive  so we took a grey view of the place  now we       are fresh and well  so it is all cheerful once more           and yet it was not entirely a question of imagination   i       answered   did you  for example  happen to hear someone  a woman       i think  sobbing in the night           that is curious  for i did when i was half asleep fancy that i       heard something of the sort  i waited quite a time  but there was       no more of it  so i concluded that it was all a dream           i heard it distinctly  and i am sure that it was really the sob       of a woman           we must ask about this right away   he rang the bell and asked       barrymore whether he could account for our experience  it seemed       to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler       still as he listened to his master s question          there are only two women in the house  sir henry   he answered         one is the scullery maid  who sleeps in the other wing  the       other is my wife  and i can answer for it that the sound could       not have come from her          and yet he lied as he said it  for it chanced that after       breakfast i met mrs  barrymore in the long corridor with the sun       full upon her face  she was a large  impassive  heavy featured       woman with a stern set expression of mouth  but her telltale eyes       were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids  it was she        then  who wept in the night  and if she did so her husband must       know it  yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in       declaring that it was not so  why had he done this  and why did       she weep so bitterly  already round this pale faced  handsome        black bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery       and of gloom  it was he who had been the first to discover the       body of sir charles  and we had only his word for all the       circumstances which led up to the old man s death  was it       possible that it was barrymore  after all  whom we had seen in       the cab in regent street  the beard might well have been the       same  the cabman had described a somewhat shorter man  but such       an impression might easily have been erroneous  how could i       settle the point forever  obviously the first thing to do was to       see the grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had       really been placed in barrymore s own hands  be the answer what       it might  i should at least have something to report to sherlock       holmes         sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast  so that       the time was propitious for my excursion  it was a pleasant walk       of four miles along the edge of the moor  leading me at last to a       small grey hamlet  in which two larger buildings  which proved to       be the inn and the house of dr  mortimer  stood high above the       rest  the postmaster  who was also the village grocer  had a       clear recollection of the telegram          certainly  sir   said he   i had the telegram delivered to mr        barrymore exactly as directed           who delivered it           my boy here  james  you delivered that telegram to mr  barrymore       at the hall last week  did you not           yes  father  i delivered it           into his own hands   i asked          well  he was up in the loft at the time  so that i could not put       it into his own hands  but i gave it into mrs  barrymore s hands        and she promised to deliver it at once           did you see mr  barrymore           no  sir  i tell you he was in the loft           if you didn t see him  how do you know he was in the loft           well  surely his own wife ought to know where he is   said the       postmaster testily   didn t he get the telegram  if there is any       mistake it is for mr  barrymore himself to complain          it seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther  but it was       clear that in spite of holmes s ruse we had no proof that       barrymore had not been in london all the time  suppose that it       were so suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen       sir charles alive  and the first to dog the new heir when he       returned to england  what then  was he the agent of others or had       he some sinister design of his own  what interest could he have       in persecuting the baskerville family  i thought of the strange       warning clipped out of the leading article of the  times   was       that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was       bent upon counteracting his schemes  the only conceivable motive       was that which had been suggested by sir henry  that if the       family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home       would be secured for the barrymores  but surely such an       explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the       deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible       net round the young baronet  holmes himself had said that no more       complex case had come to him in all the long series of his       sensational investigations  i prayed  as i walked back along the       grey  lonely road  that my friend might soon be freed from his       preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of       responsibility from my shoulders         suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running       feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name  i turned        expecting to see dr  mortimer  but to my surprise it was a       stranger who was pursuing me  he was a small  slim  clean shaven        prim faced man  flaxen haired and lean jawed  between thirty and       forty years of age  dressed in a grey suit and wearing a straw       hat  a tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and       he carried a green butterfly net in one of his hands          you will  i am sure  excuse my presumption  dr  watson   said he       as he came panting up to where i stood   here on the moor we are       homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions  you may       possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend  mortimer  i       am stapleton  of merripit house           your net and box would have told me as much   said i   for i       knew that mr  stapleton was a naturalist  but how did you know       me           i have been calling on mortimer  and he pointed you out to me       from the window of his surgery as you passed  as our road lay the       same way i thought that i would overtake you and introduce       myself  i trust that sir henry is none the worse for his       journey           he is very well  thank you           we were all rather afraid that after the sad death of sir       charles the new baronet might refuse to live here  it is asking       much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of       this kind  but i need not tell you that it means a very great       deal to the countryside  sir henry has  i suppose  no       superstitious fears in the matter           i do not think that it is likely           of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the       family           i have heard it           it is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here        any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a       creature upon the moor   he spoke with a smile  but i seemed to       read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously   the       story took a great hold upon the imagination of sir charles  and       i have no doubt that it led to his tragic end           but how           his nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog       might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart  i fancy       that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night       in the yew alley  i feared that some disaster might occur  for i       was very fond of the old man  and i knew that his heart was       weak           how did you know that           my friend mortimer told me           you think  then  that some dog pursued sir charles  and that he       died of fright in consequence           have you any better explanation           i have not come to any conclusion           has mr  sherlock holmes          the words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the       placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no       surprise was intended          it is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you  dr        watson   said he   the records of your detective have reached us       here  and you could not celebrate him without being known       yourself  when mortimer told me your name he could not deny your       identity  if you are here  then it follows that mr  sherlock       holmes is interesting himself in the matter  and i am naturally       curious to know what view he may take           i am afraid that i cannot answer that question           may i ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself           he cannot leave town at present  he has other cases which engage       his attention           what a pity  he might throw some light on that which is so dark       to us  but as to your own researches  if there is any possible       way in which i can be of service to you i trust that you will       command me  if i had any indication of the nature of your       suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case  i might       perhaps even now give you some aid or advice           i assure you that i am simply here upon a visit to my friend        sir henry  and that i need no help of any kind           excellent   said stapleton   you are perfectly right to be wary       and discreet  i am justly reproved for what i feel was an       unjustifiable intrusion  and i promise you that i will not       mention the matter again          we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from       the road and wound away across the moor  a steep        boulder sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone       days been cut into a granite quarry  the face which was turned       towards us formed a dark cliff  with ferns and brambles growing       in its niches  from over a distant rise there floated a grey       plume of smoke          a moderate walk along this moor path brings us to merripit       house   said he   perhaps you will spare an hour that i may have       the pleasure of introducing you to my sister          my first thought was that i should be by sir henry s side  but       then i remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his       study table was littered  it was certain that i could not help       with those  and holmes had expressly said that i should study the       neighbours upon the moor  i accepted stapleton s invitation  and       we turned together down the path          it is a wonderful place  the moor   said he  looking round over       the undulating downs  long green rollers  with crests of jagged       granite foaming up into fantastic surges   you never tire of the       moor  you cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains        it is so vast  and so barren  and so mysterious           you know it well  then           i have only been here two years  the residents would call me a       newcomer  we came shortly after sir charles settled  but my       tastes led me to explore every part of the country round  and i       should think that there are few men who know it better than i       do           is it hard to know           very hard  you see  for example  this great plain to the north       here with the queer hills breaking out of it  do you observe       anything remarkable about that           it would be a rare place for a gallop           you would naturally think so and the thought has cost several       their lives before now  you notice those bright green spots       scattered thickly over it           yes  they seem more fertile than the rest          stapleton laughed   that is the great grimpen mire   said he   a       false step yonder means death to man or beast  only yesterday i       saw one of the moor ponies wander into it  he never came out  i       saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog hole        but it sucked him down at last  even in dry seasons it is a       danger to cross it  but after these autumn rains it is an awful       place  and yet i can find my way to the very heart of it and       return alive  by george  there is another of those miserable       ponies          something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges        then a long  agonised  writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful       cry echoed over the moor  it turned me cold with horror  but my       companion s nerves seemed to be stronger than mine          it s gone   said he   the mire has him  two in two days  and       many more  perhaps  for they get in the way of going there in the       dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them       in its clutches  it s a bad place  the great grimpen mire           and you say you can penetrate it           yes  there are one or two paths which a very active man can       take  i have found them out           but why should you wish to go into so horrible a place           well  you see the hills beyond  they are really islands cut off       on all sides by the impassable mire  which has crawled round them       in the course of years  that is where the rare plants and the       butterflies are  if you have the wit to reach them           i shall try my luck some day          he looked at me with a surprised face   for god s sake put such       an idea out of your mind   said he   your blood would be upon my       head  i assure you that there would not be the least chance of       your coming back alive  it is only by remembering certain complex       landmarks that i am able to do it           halloa   i cried   what is that          a long  low moan  indescribably sad  swept over the moor  it       filled the whole air  and yet it was impossible to say whence it       came  from a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar  and then       sank back into a melancholy  throbbing murmur once again        stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face          queer place  the moor   said he          but what is it           the peasants say it is the hound of the baskervilles calling for       its prey  i ve heard it once or twice before  but never quite so       loud          i looked round  with a chill of fear in my heart  at the huge       swelling plain  mottled with the green patches of rushes  nothing       stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens  which       croaked loudly from a tor behind us          you are an educated man  you don t believe such nonsense as       that   said i   what do you think is the cause of so strange a       sound           bogs make queer noises sometimes  it s the mud settling  or the       water rising  or something           no  no  that was a living voice           well  perhaps it was  did you ever hear a bittern booming           no  i never did           it s a very rare bird practically extinct in england now  but       all things are possible upon the moor  yes  i should not be       surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last       of the bitterns           it s the weirdest  strangest thing that ever i heard in my       life           yes  it s rather an uncanny place altogether  look at the       hillside yonder  what do you make of those          the whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings of       stone  a score of them at least          what are they  sheep pens           no  they are the homes of our worthy ancestors  prehistoric man       lived thickly on the moor  and as no one in particular has lived       there since  we find all his little arrangements exactly as he       left them  these are his wigwams with the roofs off  you can even       see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go       inside          but it is quite a town  when was it inhabited           neolithic man no date           what did he do           he grazed his cattle on these slopes  and he learned to dig for       tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe  look       at the great trench in the opposite hill  that is his mark  yes        you will find some very singular points about the moor  dr        watson  oh  excuse me an instant  it is surely cyclopides          a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path  and in an       instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed       in pursuit of it  to my dismay the creature flew straight for the       great mire  and my acquaintance never paused for an instant        bounding from tuft to tuft behind it  his green net waving in the       air  his grey clothes and jerky  zigzag  irregular progress made       him not unlike some huge moth himself  i was standing watching       his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary       activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the       treacherous mire  when i heard the sound of steps and  turning       round  found a woman near me upon the path  she had come from the       direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of       merripit house  but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was       quite close         i could not doubt that this was the miss stapleton of whom i had       been told  since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor        and i remembered that i had heard someone describe her as being a       beauty  the woman who approached me was certainly that  and of a       most uncommon type  there could not have been a greater contrast       between brother and sister  for stapleton was neutral tinted        with light hair and grey eyes  while she was darker than any       brunette whom i have seen in england slim  elegant  and tall  she       had a proud  finely cut face  so regular that it might have       seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the       beautiful dark  eager eyes  with her perfect figure and elegant       dress she was  indeed  a strange apparition upon a lonely       moorland path  her eyes were on her brother as i turned  and then       she quickened her pace towards me  i had raised my hat and was       about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned       all my thoughts into a new channel          go back   she said   go straight back to london  instantly          i could only stare at her in stupid surprise  her eyes blazed at       me  and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot          why should i go back   i asked          i cannot explain   she spoke in a low  eager voice  with a       curious lisp in her utterance   but for god s sake do what i ask       you  go back and never set foot upon the moor again           but i have only just come           man  man   she cried   can you not tell when a warning is for       your own good  go back to london  start tonight  get away from       this place at all costs  hush  my brother is coming  not a word       of what i have said  would you mind getting that orchid for me       among the mare s tails yonder  we are very rich in orchids on the       moor  though  of course  you are rather late to see the beauties       of the place          stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing       hard and flushed with his exertions          halloa  beryl   said he  and it seemed to me that the tone of       his greeting was not altogether a cordial one          well  jack  you are very hot           yes  i was chasing a cyclopides  he is very rare and seldom       found in the late autumn  what a pity that i should have missed       him   he spoke unconcernedly  but his small light eyes glanced       incessantly from the girl to me          you have introduced yourselves  i can see           yes  i was telling sir henry that it was rather late for him to       see the true beauties of the moor           why  who do you think this is           i imagine that it must be sir henry baskerville           no  no   said i   only a humble commoner  but his friend  my       name is dr  watson          a flush of vexation passed over her expressive face   we have       been talking at cross purposes   said she          why  you had not very much time for talk   her brother remarked       with the same questioning eyes          i talked as if dr  watson were a resident instead of being       merely a visitor   said she   it cannot much matter to him       whether it is early or late for the orchids  but you will come       on  will you not  and see merripit house          a short walk brought us to it  a bleak moorland house  once the       farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days  but now put into       repair and turned into a modern dwelling  an orchard surrounded       it  but the trees  as is usual upon the moor  were stunted and       nipped  and the effect of the whole place was mean and       melancholy  we were admitted by a strange  wizened  rusty coated       old manservant  who seemed in keeping with the house  inside        however  there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in       which i seemed to recognize the taste of the lady  as i looked       from their windows at the interminable granite flecked moor       rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon i could not but marvel       at what could have brought this highly educated man and this       beautiful woman to live in such a place          queer spot to choose  is it not   said he as if in answer to my       thought   and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy  do we       not  beryl           quite happy   said she  but there was no ring of conviction in       her words          i had a school   said stapleton   it was in the north country        the work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and       uninteresting  but the privilege of living with youth  of helping       to mould those young minds  and of impressing them with one s own       character and ideals was very dear to me  however  the fates were       against us  a serious epidemic broke out in the school and three       of the boys died  it never recovered from the blow  and much of       my capital was irretrievably swallowed up  and yet  if it were       not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys  i       could rejoice over my own misfortune  for  with my strong tastes       for botany and zoology  i find an unlimited field of work here        and my sister is as devoted to nature as i am  all this  dr        watson  has been brought upon your head by your expression as you       surveyed the moor out of our window           it certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little       dull less for you  perhaps  than for your sister           no  no  i am never dull   said she quickly          we have books  we have our studies  and we have interesting       neighbours  dr  mortimer is a most learned man in his own line        poor sir charles was also an admirable companion  we knew him       well and miss him more than i can tell  do you think that i       should intrude if i were to call this afternoon and make the       acquaintance of sir henry           i am sure that he would be delighted           then perhaps you would mention that i propose to do so  we may       in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him       until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings  will you       come upstairs  dr  watson  and inspect my collection of       lepidoptera  i think it is the most complete one in the       south west of england  by the time that you have looked through       them lunch will be almost ready          but i was eager to get back to my charge  the melancholy of the       moor  the death of the unfortunate pony  the weird sound which       had been associated with the grim legend of the baskervilles  all       these things tinged my thoughts with sadness  then on the top of       these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite       and distinct warning of miss stapleton  delivered with such       intense earnestness that i could not doubt that some grave and       deep reason lay behind it  i resisted all pressure to stay for       lunch  and i set off at once upon my return journey  taking the       grass grown path by which we had come         it seems  however  that there must have been some short cut for       those who knew it  for before i had reached the road i was       astounded to see miss stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side       of the track  her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions       and she held her hand to her side          i have run all the way in order to cut you off  dr  watson         said she   i had not even time to put on my hat  i must not stop        or my brother may miss me  i wanted to say to you how sorry i am       about the stupid mistake i made in thinking that you were sir       henry  please forget the words i said  which have no application       whatever to you           but i can t forget them  miss stapleton   said i   i am sir       henry s friend  and his welfare is a very close concern of mine        tell me why it was that you were so eager that sir henry should       return to london           a woman s whim  dr  watson  when you know me better you will       understand that i cannot always give reasons for what i say or       do           no  no  i remember the thrill in your voice  i remember the look       in your eyes  please  please  be frank with me  miss stapleton        for ever since i have been here i have been conscious of shadows       all round me  life has become like that great grimpen mire  with       little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with       no guide to point the track  tell me then what it was that you       meant  and i will promise to convey your warning to sir henry          an expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her       face  but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me          you make too much of it  dr  watson   said she   my brother and       i were very much shocked by the death of sir charles  we knew him       very intimately  for his favourite walk was over the moor to our       house  he was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the       family  and when this tragedy came i naturally felt that there       must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed  i was       distressed therefore when another member of the family came down       to live here  and i felt that he should be warned of the danger       which he will run  that was all which i intended to convey          but what is the danger           you know the story of the hound           i do not believe in such nonsense           but i do  if you have any influence with sir henry  take him       away from a place which has always been fatal to his family  the       world is wide  why should he wish to live at the place of       danger           because it  is  the place of danger  that is sir henry s nature        i fear that unless you can give me some more definite information       than this it would be impossible to get him to move           i cannot say anything definite  for i do not know anything       definite           i would ask you one more question  miss stapleton  if you meant       no more than this when you first spoke to me  why should you not       wish your brother to overhear what you said  there is nothing to       which he  or anyone else  could object           my brother is very anxious to have the hall inhabited  for he       thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor  he       would be very angry if he knew that i have said anything which       might induce sir henry to go away  but i have done my duty now       and i will say no more  i must go back  or he will miss me and       suspect that i have seen you  good bye   she turned and had       disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders  while       i  with my soul full of vague fears  pursued my way to       baskerville hall     chapter     first report of dr  watson        from this point onward i will follow the course of events by       transcribing my own letters to mr  sherlock holmes which lie       before me on the table  one page is missing  but otherwise they       are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the       moment more accurately than my memory  clear as it is upon these       tragic events  can possibly do         baskerville hall  october   th         my dear holmes         my previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to       date as to all that has occurred in this most god forsaken corner       of the world  the longer one stays here the more does the spirit       of the moor sink into one s soul  its vastness  and also its grim       charm  when you are once out upon its bosom you have left all       traces of modern england behind you  but  on the other hand  you       are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the       prehistoric people  on all sides of you as you walk are the       houses of these forgotten folk  with their graves and the huge       monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples  as you       look at their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides you       leave your own age behind you  and if you were to see a       skin clad  hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a       flint tipped arrow on to the string of his bow  you would feel       that his presence there was more natural than your own  the       strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what       must always have been most unfruitful soil  i am no antiquarian        but i could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried       race who were forced to accept that which none other would       occupy         all this  however  is foreign to the mission on which you sent me       and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely       practical mind  i can still remember your complete indifference       as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round       the sun  let me  therefore  return to the facts concerning sir       henry baskerville         if you have not had any report within the last few days it is       because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate        then a very surprising circumstance occurred  which i shall tell       you in due course  but  first of all  i must keep you in touch       with some of the other factors in the situation         one of these  concerning which i have said little  is the escaped       convict upon the moor  there is strong reason now to believe that       he has got right away  which is a considerable relief to the       lonely householders of this district  a fortnight has passed       since his flight  during which he has not been seen and nothing       has been heard of him  it is surely inconceivable that he could       have held out upon the moor during all that time  of course  so       far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all  any       one of these stone huts would give him a hiding place  but there       is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of       the moor sheep  we think  therefore  that he has gone  and the       outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence         we are four able bodied men in this household  so that we could       take good care of ourselves  but i confess that i have had uneasy       moments when i have thought of the stapletons  they live miles       from any help  there are one maid  an old manservant  the sister        and the brother  the latter not a very strong man  they would be       helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this notting       hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance  both sir henry       and i were concerned at their situation  and it was suggested       that perkins the groom should go over to sleep there  but       stapleton would not hear of it         the fact is that our friend  the baronet  begins to display a       considerable interest in our fair neighbour  it is not to be       wondered at  for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an       active man like him  and she is a very fascinating and beautiful       woman  there is something tropical and exotic about her which       forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother        yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires  he has certainly a       very marked influence over her  for i have seen her continually       glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what       she said  i trust that he is kind to her  there is a dry glitter       in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips  which goes with a       positive and possibly a harsh nature  you would find him an       interesting study         he came over to call upon baskerville on that first day  and the       very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the       legend of the wicked hugo is supposed to have had its origin  it       was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which       is so dismal that it might have suggested the story  we found a       short valley between rugged tors which led to an open  grassy       space flecked over with the white cotton grass  in the middle of       it rose two great stones  worn and sharpened at the upper end       until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous       beast  in every way it corresponded with the scene of the old       tragedy  sir henry was much interested and asked stapleton more       than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the       interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men  he spoke       lightly  but it was evident that he was very much in earnest        stapleton was guarded in his replies  but it was easy to see that       he said less than he might  and that he would not express his       whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the       baronet  he told us of similar cases  where families had suffered       from some evil influence  and he left us with the impression that       he shared the popular view upon the matter         on our way back we stayed for lunch at merripit house  and it was       there that sir henry made the acquaintance of miss stapleton        from the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly       attracted by her  and i am much mistaken if the feeling was not       mutual  he referred to her again and again on our walk home  and       since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen       something of the brother and sister  they dine here tonight  and       there is some talk of our going to them next week  one would       imagine that such a match would be very welcome to stapleton  and       yet i have more than once caught a look of the strongest       disapprobation in his face when sir henry has been paying some       attention to his sister  he is much attached to her  no doubt        and would lead a lonely life without her  but it would seem the       height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her       making so brilliant a marriage  yet i am certain that he does not       wish their intimacy to ripen into love  and i have several times       observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being        t te   t te   by the way  your instructions to me never to allow       sir henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a       love affair were to be added to our other difficulties  my       popularity would soon suffer if i were to carry out your orders       to the letter         the other day thursday  to be more exact dr  mortimer lunched       with us  he has been excavating a barrow at long down and has got       a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy  never was       there such a single minded enthusiast as he  the stapletons came       in afterwards  and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley       at sir henry s request to show us exactly how everything occurred       upon that fatal night  it is a long  dismal walk  the yew alley        between two high walls of clipped hedge  with a narrow band of       grass upon either side  at the far end is an old tumble down       summer house  halfway down is the moor gate  where the old       gentleman left his cigar ash  it is a white wooden gate with a       latch  beyond it lies the wide moor  i remembered your theory of       the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred  as the old       man stood there he saw something coming across the moor        something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran       and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion  there was       the long  gloomy tunnel down which he fled  and from what  a       sheep dog of the moor  or a spectral hound  black  silent  and       monstrous  was there a human agency in the matter  did the pale        watchful barrymore know more than he cared to say  it was all dim       and vague  but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind       it         one other neighbour i have met since i wrote last  this is mr        frankland  of lafter hall  who lives some four miles to the south       of us  he is an elderly man  red faced  white haired  and       choleric  his passion is for the british law  and he has spent a       large fortune in litigation  he fights for the mere pleasure of       fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a       question  so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly       amusement  sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the       parish to make him open it  at others he will with his own hands       tear down some other man s gate and declare that a path has       existed there from time immemorial  defying the owner to       prosecute him for trespass  he is learned in old manorial and       communal rights  and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour       of the villagers of fernworthy and sometimes against them  so       that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the       village street or else burned in effigy  according to his latest       exploit  he is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands       at present  which will probably swallow up the remainder of his       fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the       future  apart from the law he seems a kindly  good natured       person  and i only mention him because you were particular that i       should send some description of the people who surround us  he is       curiously employed at present  for  being an amateur astronomer        he has an excellent telescope  with which he lies upon the roof       of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of       catching a glimpse of the escaped convict  if he would confine       his energies to this all would be well  but there are rumours       that he intends to prosecute dr  mortimer for opening a grave       without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the       neolithic skull in the barrow on long down  he helps to keep our       lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where       it is badly needed         and now  having brought you up to date in the escaped convict        the stapletons  dr  mortimer  and frankland  of lafter hall  let       me end on that which is most important and tell you more about       the barrymores  and especially about the surprising development       of last night         first of all about the test telegram  which you sent from london       in order to make sure that barrymore was really here  i have       already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that       the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the       other  i told sir henry how the matter stood  and he at once  in       his downright fashion  had barrymore up and asked him whether he       had received the telegram himself  barrymore said that he had          did the boy deliver it into your own hands   asked sir henry         barrymore looked surprised  and considered for a little time          no   said he   i was in the box room at the time  and my wife       brought it up to me           did you answer it yourself           no  i told my wife what to answer and she went down to write       it          in the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord          i could not quite understand the object of your questions this       morning  sir henry   said he   i trust that they do not mean that       i have done anything to forfeit your confidence          sir henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by       giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe  the london       outfit having now all arrived         mrs  barrymore is of interest to me  she is a heavy  solid       person  very limited  intensely respectable  and inclined to be       puritanical  you could hardly conceive a less emotional subject        yet i have told you how  on the first night here  i heard her       sobbing bitterly  and since then i have more than once observed       traces of tears upon her face  some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her       heart  sometimes i wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts       her  and sometimes i suspect barrymore of being a domestic       tyrant  i have always felt that there was something singular and       questionable in this man s character  but the adventure of last       night brings all my suspicions to a head         and yet it may seem a small matter in itself  you are aware that       i am not a very sound sleeper  and since i have been on guard in       this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever  last night        about two in the morning  i was aroused by a stealthy step       passing my room  i rose  opened my door  and peeped out  a long       black shadow was trailing down the corridor  it was thrown by a       man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his       hand  he was in shirt and trousers  with no covering to his feet        i could merely see the outline  but his height told me that it       was barrymore  he walked very slowly and circumspectly  and there       was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole       appearance         i have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which       runs round the hall  but that it is resumed upon the farther       side  i waited until he had passed out of sight and then i       followed him  when i came round the balcony he had reached the       end of the farther corridor  and i could see from the glimmer of       light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms        now  all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his       expedition became more mysterious than ever  the light shone       steadily as if he were standing motionless  i crept down the       passage as noiselessly as i could and peeped round the corner of       the door         barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held       against the glass  his profile was half turned towards me  and       his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out       into the blackness of the moor  for some minutes he stood       watching intently  then he gave a deep groan and with an       impatient gesture he put out the light  instantly i made my way       back to my room  and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing       once more upon their return journey  long afterwards when i had       fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock        but i could not tell whence the sound came  what it all means i       cannot guess  but there is some secret business going on in this       house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom       of  i do not trouble you with my theories  for you asked me to       furnish you only with facts  i have had a long talk with sir       henry this morning  and we have made a plan of campaign founded       upon my observations of last night  i will not speak about it       just now  but it should make my next report interesting reading     chapter     the light upon the moor  second report of dr  watson         baskerville hall  oct    th         my dear holmes         if i was compelled to leave you without much news during the       early days of my mission you must acknowledge that i am making up       for lost time  and that events are now crowding thick and fast       upon us  in my last report i ended upon my top note with       barrymore at the window  and now i have quite a budget already       which will  unless i am much mistaken  considerably surprise you        things have taken a turn which i could not have anticipated  in       some ways they have within the last forty eight hours become much       clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated  but i       will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself         before breakfast on the morning following my adventure i went       down the corridor and examined the room in which barrymore had       been on the night before  the western window through which he had       stared so intently has  i noticed  one peculiarity above all       other windows in the house it commands the nearest outlook on to       the moor  there is an opening between two trees which enables one       from this point of view to look right down upon it  while from       all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be       obtained  it follows  therefore  that barrymore  since only this       window would serve the purpose  must have been looking out for       something or somebody upon the moor  the night was very dark  so       that i can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone        it had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was       on foot  that would have accounted for his stealthy movements and       also for the uneasiness of his wife  the man is a       striking looking fellow  very well equipped to steal the heart of       a country girl  so that this theory seemed to have something to       support it  that opening of the door which i had heard after i       had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep       some clandestine appointment  so i reasoned with myself in the       morning  and i tell you the direction of my suspicions  however       much the result may have shown that they were unfounded         but whatever the true explanation of barrymore s movements might       be  i felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself       until i could explain them was more than i could bear  i had an       interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast  and i       told him all that i had seen  he was less surprised than i had       expected          i knew that barrymore walked about nights  and i had a mind to       speak to him about it   said he   two or three times i have heard       his steps in the passage  coming and going  just about the hour       you name           perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular       window   i suggested          perhaps he does  if so  we should be able to shadow him and see       what it is that he is after  i wonder what your friend holmes       would do if he were here           i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest   said       i   he would follow barrymore and see what he did           then we shall do it together           but surely he would hear us           the man is rather deaf  and in any case we must take our chance       of that  we ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he       passes   sir henry rubbed his hands with pleasure  and it was       evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat       quiet life upon the moor         the baronet has been in communication with the architect who       prepared the plans for sir charles  and with a contractor from       london  so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon        there have been decorators and furnishers up from plymouth  and       it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare       no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family  when       the house is renovated and refurnished  all that he will need       will be a wife to make it complete  between ourselves there are       pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is       willing  for i have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a       woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour  miss stapleton        and yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as       one would under the circumstances expect  today  for example  its       surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple  which has caused       our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance         after the conversation which i have quoted about barrymore  sir       henry put on his hat and prepared to go out  as a matter of       course i did the same          what  are  you  coming  watson   he asked  looking at me in a       curious way          that depends on whether you are going on the moor   said i          yes  i am           well  you know what my instructions are  i am sorry to intrude        but you heard how earnestly holmes insisted that i should not       leave you  and especially that you should not go alone upon the       moor          sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile          my dear fellow   said he   holmes  with all his wisdom  did not       foresee some things which have happened since i have been on the       moor  you understand me  i am sure that you are the last man in       the world who would wish to be a spoil sport  i must go out       alone          it put me in a most awkward position  i was at a loss what to say       or what to do  and before i had made up my mind he picked up his       cane and was gone         but when i came to think the matter over my conscience reproached       me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my       sight  i imagined what my feelings would be if i had to return to       you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my       disregard for your instructions  i assure you my cheeks flushed       at the very thought  it might not even now be too late to       overtake him  so i set off at once in the direction of merripit       house         i hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing       anything of sir henry  until i came to the point where the moor       path branches off  there  fearing that perhaps i had come in the       wrong direction after all  i mounted a hill from which i could       command a view the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry        thence i saw him at once  he was on the moor path about a quarter       of a mile off  and a lady was by his side who could only be miss       stapleton  it was clear that there was already an understanding       between them and that they had met by appointment  they were       walking slowly along in deep conversation  and i saw her making       quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest       in what she was saying  while he listened intently  and once or       twice shook his head in strong dissent  i stood among the rocks       watching them  very much puzzled as to what i should do next  to       follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to       be an outrage  and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to       let him out of my sight  to act the spy upon a friend was a       hateful task  still  i could see no better course than to observe       him from the hill  and to clear my conscience by confessing to       him afterwards what i had done  it is true that if any sudden       danger had threatened him i was too far away to be of use  and       yet i am sure that you will agree with me that the position was       very difficult  and that there was nothing more which i could do         our friend  sir henry  and the lady had halted on the path and       were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation  when i was       suddenly aware that i was not the only witness of their       interview  a wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye  and       another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man       who was moving among the broken ground  it was stapleton with his       butterfly net  he was very much closer to the pair than i was        and he appeared to be moving in their direction  at this instant       sir henry suddenly drew miss stapleton to his side  his arm was       round her  but it seemed to me that she was straining away from       him with her face averted  he stooped his head to hers  and she       raised one hand as if in protest  next moment i saw them spring       apart and turn hurriedly round  stapleton was the cause of the       interruption  he was running wildly towards them  his absurd net       dangling behind him  he gesticulated and almost danced with       excitement in front of the lovers  what the scene meant i could       not imagine  but it seemed to me that stapleton was abusing sir       henry  who offered explanations  which became more angry as the       other refused to accept them  the lady stood by in haughty       silence  finally stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a       peremptory way to his sister  who  after an irresolute glance at       sir henry  walked off by the side of her brother  the       naturalist s angry gestures showed that the lady was included in       his displeasure  the baronet stood for a minute looking after       them  and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come        his head hanging  the very picture of dejection         what all this meant i could not imagine  but i was deeply ashamed       to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend s       knowledge  i ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at       the bottom  his face was flushed with anger and his brows were       wrinkled  like one who is at his wit s ends what to do          halloa  watson  where have you dropped from   said he   you       don t mean to say that you came after me in spite of all          i explained everything to him  how i had found it impossible to       remain behind  how i had followed him  and how i had witnessed       all that had occurred  for an instant his eyes blazed at me  but       my frankness disarmed his anger  and he broke at last into a       rather rueful laugh          you would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe       place for a man to be private   said he   but  by thunder  the       whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my       wooing and a mighty poor wooing at that  where had you engaged a       seat           i was on that hill           quite in the back row  eh  but her brother was well up to the       front  did you see him come out on us           yes  i did           did he ever strike you as being crazy this brother of hers           i can t say that he ever did           i dare say not  i always thought him sane enough until today        but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a       straitjacket  what s the matter with me  anyhow  you ve lived       near me for some weeks  watson  tell me straight  now  is there       anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a       woman that i loved           i should say not           he can t object to my worldly position  so it must be myself       that he has this down on  what has he against me  i never hurt       man or woman in my life that i know of  and yet he would not so       much as let me touch the tips of her fingers           did he say so           that  and a deal more  i tell you  watson  i ve only known her       these few weeks  but from the first i just felt that she was made       for me  and she  too she was happy when she was with me  and that       i ll swear  there s a light in a woman s eyes that speaks louder       than words  but he has never let us get together and it was only       today for the first time that i saw a chance of having a few       words with her alone  she was glad to meet me  but when she did       it was not love that she would talk about  and she wouldn t have       let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it  she       kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger  and that       she would never be happy until i had left it  i told her that       since i had seen her i was in no hurry to leave it  and that if       she really wanted me to go  the only way to work it was for her       to arrange to go with me  with that i offered in as many words to       marry her  but before she could answer  down came this brother of       hers  running at us with a face on him like a madman  he was just       white with rage  and those light eyes of his were blazing with       fury  what was i doing with the lady  how dared i offer her       attentions which were distasteful to her  did i think that       because i was a baronet i could do what i liked  if he had not       been her brother i should have known better how to answer him  as       it was i told him that my feelings towards his sister were such       as i was not ashamed of  and that i hoped that she might honour       me by becoming my wife  that seemed to make the matter no better        so then i lost my temper too  and i answered him rather more       hotly than i should perhaps  considering that she was standing       by  so it ended by his going off with her  as you saw  and here       am i as badly puzzled a man as any in this county  just tell me       what it all means  watson  and i ll owe you more than ever i can       hope to pay          i tried one or two explanations  but  indeed  i was completely       puzzled myself  our friend s title  his fortune  his age  his       character  and his appearance are all in his favour  and i know       nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his       family  that his advances should be rejected so brusquely without       any reference to the lady s own wishes and that the lady should       accept the situation without protest is very amazing  however        our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from stapleton       himself that very afternoon  he had come to offer apologies for       his rudeness of the morning  and after a long private interview       with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was       that the breach is quite healed  and that we are to dine at       merripit house next friday as a sign of it          i don t say now that he isn t a crazy man   said sir henry   i       can t forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning        but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology       than he has done           did he give any explanation of his conduct           his sister is everything in his life  he says  that is natural       enough  and i am glad that he should understand her value  they       have always been together  and according to his account he has       been a very lonely man with only her as a companion  so that the       thought of losing her was really terrible to him  he had not       understood  he said  that i was becoming attached to her  but       when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so  and that she       might be taken away from him  it gave him such a shock that for a       time he was not responsible for what he said or did  he was very       sorry for all that had passed  and he recognized how foolish and       how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a       beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life  if       she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like       myself than to anyone else  but in any case it was a blow to him       and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself       to meet it  he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i       would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be       content with cultivating the lady s friendship during that time       without claiming her love  this i promised  and so the matter       rests          so there is one of our small mysteries cleared up  it is       something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we       are floundering  we know now why stapleton looked with disfavour       upon his sister s suitor even when that suitor was so eligible a       one as sir henry  and now i pass on to another thread which i       have extricated out of the tangled skein  the mystery of the sobs       in the night  of the tear stained face of mrs  barrymore  of the       secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window        congratulate me  my dear holmes  and tell me that i have not       disappointed you as an agent that you do not regret the       confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down  all       these things have by one night s work been thoroughly cleared         i have said  by one night s work   but  in truth  it was by two       nights  work  for on the first we drew entirely blank  i sat up       with sir henry in his rooms until nearly three o clock in the       morning  but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming       clock upon the stairs  it was a most melancholy vigil and ended       by each of us falling asleep in our chairs  fortunately we were       not discouraged  and we determined to try again  the next night       we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the       least sound  it was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by        and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient       interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into       which he hopes the game may wander  one struck  and two  and we       had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an       instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary       senses keenly on the alert once more  we had heard the creak of a       step in the passage         very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the       distance  then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out       in pursuit  already our man had gone round the gallery and the       corridor was all in darkness  softly we stole along until we had       come into the other wing  we were just in time to catch a glimpse       of the tall  black bearded figure  his shoulders rounded as he       tiptoed down the passage  then he passed through the same door as       before  and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and       shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor  we       shuffled cautiously towards it  trying every plank before we       dared to put our whole weight upon it  we had taken the       precaution of leaving our boots behind us  but  even so  the old       boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread  sometimes it seemed       impossible that he should fail to hear our approach  however  the       man is fortunately rather deaf  and he was entirely preoccupied       in that which he was doing  when at last we reached the door and       peeped through we found him crouching at the window  candle in       hand  his white  intent face pressed against the pane  exactly as       i had seen him two nights before         we had arranged no plan of campaign  but the baronet is a man to       whom the most direct way is always the most natural  he walked       into the room  and as he did so barrymore sprang up from the       window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood  livid and       trembling  before us  his dark eyes  glaring out of the white       mask of his face  were full of horror and astonishment as he       gazed from sir henry to me          what are you doing here  barrymore           nothing  sir   his agitation was so great that he could hardly       speak  and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his       candle   it was the window  sir  i go round at night to see that       they are fastened           on the second floor           yes  sir  all the windows           look here  barrymore   said sir henry sternly   we have made up       our minds to have the truth out of you  so it will save you       trouble to tell it sooner rather than later  come  now  no lies        what were you doing at that window          the fellow looked at us in a helpless way  and he wrung his hands       together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and       misery          i was doing no harm  sir  i was holding a candle to the window           and why were you holding a candle to the window           don t ask me  sir henry don t ask me  i give you my word  sir        that it is not my secret  and that i cannot tell it  if it       concerned no one but myself i would not try to keep it from you          a sudden idea occurred to me  and i took the candle from the       trembling hand of the butler          he must have been holding it as a signal   said i   let us see       if there is any answer   i held it as he had done  and stared out       into the darkness of the night  vaguely i could discern the black       bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor  for the       moon was behind the clouds  and then i gave a cry of exultation        for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the       dark veil  and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square       framed by the window          there it is   i cried          no  no  sir  it is nothing nothing at all   the butler broke in         i assure you  sir           move your light across the window  watson   cried the baronet         see  the other moves also  now  you rascal  do you deny that it       is a signal  come  speak up  who is your confederate out yonder        and what is this conspiracy that is going on          the man s face became openly defiant   it is my business  and not       yours  i will not tell           then you leave my employment right away           very good  sir  if i must i must           and you go in disgrace  by thunder  you may well be ashamed of       yourself  your family has lived with mine for over a hundred       years under this roof  and here i find you deep in some dark plot       against me           no  no  sir  no  not against you   it was a woman s voice  and       mrs  barrymore  paler and more horror struck than her husband        was standing at the door  her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt       might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling       upon her face          we have to go  eliza  this is the end of it  you can pack our       things   said the butler          oh  john  john  have i brought you to this  it is my doing  sir       henry all mine  he has done nothing except for my sake and       because i asked him           speak out  then  what does it mean           my unhappy brother is starving on the moor  we cannot let him       perish at our very gates  the light is a signal to him that food       is ready for him  and his light out yonder is to show the spot to       which to bring it           then your brother is           the escaped convict  sir selden  the criminal           that s the truth  sir   said barrymore   i said that it was not       my secret and that i could not tell it to you  but now you have       heard it  and you will see that if there was a plot it was not       against you          this  then  was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at       night and the light at the window  sir henry and i both stared at       the woman in amazement  was it possible that this stolidly       respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most       notorious criminals in the country          yes  sir  my name was selden  and he is my younger brother  we       humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way       in everything until he came to think that the world was made for       his pleasure  and that he could do what he liked in it  then as       he grew older he met wicked companions  and the devil entered       into him until he broke my mother s heart and dragged our name in       the dirt  from crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is       only the mercy of god which has snatched him from the scaffold        but to me  sir  he was always the little curly headed boy that i       had nursed and played with as an elder sister would  that was why       he broke prison  sir  he knew that i was here and that we could       not refuse to help him  when he dragged himself here one night        weary and starving  with the warders hard at his heels  what       could we do  we took him in and fed him and cared for him  then       you returned  sir  and my brother thought he would be safer on       the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over  so he       lay in hiding there  but every second night we made sure if he       was still there by putting a light in the window  and if there       was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him        every day we hoped that he was gone  but as long as he was there       we could not desert him  that is the whole truth  as i am an       honest christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in       the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me  for whose       sake he has done all that he has          the woman s words came with an intense earnestness which carried       conviction with them          is this true  barrymore           yes  sir henry  every word of it           well  i cannot blame you for standing by your own wife  forget       what i have said  go to your room  you two  and we shall talk       further about this matter in the morning          when they were gone we looked out of the window again  sir henry       had flung it open  and the cold night wind beat in upon our       faces  far away in the black distance there still glowed that one       tiny point of yellow light          i wonder he dares   said sir henry          it may be so placed as to be only visible from here           very likely  how far do you think it is           out by the cleft tor  i think           not more than a mile or two off           hardly that           well  it cannot be far if barrymore had to carry out the food to       it  and he is waiting  this villain  beside that candle  by       thunder  watson  i am going out to take that man          the same thought had crossed my own mind  it was not as if the       barrymores had taken us into their confidence  their secret had       been forced from them  the man was a danger to the community  an       unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse        we were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him       back where he could do no harm  with his brutal and violent       nature  others would have to pay the price if we held our hands        any night  for example  our neighbours the stapletons might be       attacked by him  and it may have been the thought of this which       made sir henry so keen upon the adventure          i will come   said i          then get your revolver and put on your boots  the sooner we       start the better  as the fellow may put out his light and be       off          in five minutes we were outside the door  starting upon our       expedition  we hurried through the dark shrubbery  amid the dull       moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves        the night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay  now and       again the moon peeped out for an instant  but clouds were driving       over the face of the sky  and just as we came out on the moor a       thin rain began to fall  the light still burned steadily in       front          are you armed   i asked          i have a hunting crop           we must close in on him rapidly  for he is said to be a       desperate fellow  we shall take him by surprise and have him at       our mercy before he can resist           i say  watson   said the baronet   what would holmes say to       this  how about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil       is exalted          as if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast       gloom of the moor that strange cry which i had already heard upon       the borders of the great grimpen mire  it came with the wind       through the silence of the night  a long  deep mutter  then a       rising howl  and then the sad moan in which it died away  again       and again it sounded  the whole air throbbing with it  strident        wild  and menacing  the baronet caught my sleeve and his face       glimmered white through the darkness          my god  what s that  watson           i don t know  it s a sound they have on the moor  i heard it       once before          it died away  and an absolute silence closed in upon us  we stood       straining our ears  but nothing came          watson   said the baronet   it was the cry of a hound          my blood ran cold in my veins  for there was a break in his voice       which told of the sudden horror which had seized him          what do they call this sound   he asked          who           the folk on the countryside           oh  they are ignorant people  why should you mind what they call       it           tell me  watson  what do they say of it          i hesitated but could not escape the question          they say it is the cry of the hound of the baskervilles          he groaned and was silent for a few moments          a hound it was   he said at last   but it seemed to come from       miles away  over yonder  i think           it was hard to say whence it came           it rose and fell with the wind  isn t that the direction of the       great grimpen mire           yes  it is           well  it was up there  come now  watson  didn t you think       yourself that it was the cry of a hound  i am not a child  you       need not fear to speak the truth           stapleton was with me when i heard it last  he said that it       might be the calling of a strange bird           no  no  it was a hound  my god  can there be some truth in all       these stories  is it possible that i am really in danger from so       dark a cause  you don t believe it  do you  watson           no  no           and yet it was one thing to laugh about it in london  and it is       another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear       such a cry as that  and my uncle  there was the footprint of the       hound beside him as he lay  it all fits together  i don t think       that i am a coward  watson  but that sound seemed to freeze my       very blood  feel my hand          it was as cold as a block of marble          you ll be all right tomorrow           i don t think i ll get that cry out of my head  what do you       advise that we do now           shall we turn back           no  by thunder  we have come out to get our man  and we will do       it  we after the convict  and a hell hound  as likely as not        after us  come on  we ll see it through if all the fiends of the       pit were loose upon the moor          we stumbled slowly along in the darkness  with the black loom of       the craggy hills around us  and the yellow speck of light burning       steadily in front  there is nothing so deceptive as the distance       of a light upon a pitch dark night  and sometimes the glimmer       seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might       have been within a few yards of us  but at last we could see       whence it came  and then we knew that we were indeed very close        a guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which       flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also       to prevent it from being visible  save in the direction of       baskerville hall  a boulder of granite concealed our approach        and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light  it       was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle       of the moor  with no sign of life near it just the one straight       yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it          what shall we do now   whispered sir henry          wait here  he must be near his light  let us see if we can get a       glimpse of him          the words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him  over       the rocks  in the crevice of which the candle burned  there was       thrust out an evil yellow face  a terrible animal face  all       seamed and scored with vile passions  foul with mire  with a       bristling beard  and hung with matted hair  it might well have       belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on       the hillsides  the light beneath him was reflected in his small        cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the       darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps       of the hunters         something had evidently aroused his suspicions  it may have been       that barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to       give  or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking       that all was not well  but i could read his fears upon his wicked       face  any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the       darkness  i sprang forward therefore  and sir henry did the same        at the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and       hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had       sheltered us  i caught one glimpse of his short  squat  strongly       built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run  at the       same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds        we rushed over the brow of the hill  and there was our man       running with great speed down the other side  springing over the       stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat  a lucky       long shot of my revolver might have crippled him  but i had       brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an       unarmed man who was running away         we were both swift runners and in fairly good training  but we       soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him  we saw him       for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck       moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant       hill  we ran and ran until we were completely blown  but the       space between us grew ever wider  finally we stopped and sat       panting on two rocks  while we watched him disappearing in the       distance         and it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and       unexpected thing  we had risen from our rocks and were turning to       go home  having abandoned the hopeless chase  the moon was low       upon the right  and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up       against the lower curve of its silver disc  there  outlined as       black as an ebony statue on that shining background  i saw the       figure of a man upon the tor  do not think that it was a       delusion  holmes  i assure you that i have never in my life seen       anything more clearly  as far as i could judge  the figure was       that of a tall  thin man  he stood with his legs a little       separated  his arms folded  his head bowed  as if he were       brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which       lay before him  he might have been the very spirit of that       terrible place  it was not the convict  this man was far from the       place where the latter had disappeared  besides  he was a much       taller man  with a cry of surprise i pointed him out to the       baronet  but in the instant during which i had turned to grasp       his arm the man was gone  there was the sharp pinnacle of granite       still cutting the lower edge of the moon  but its peak bore no       trace of that silent and motionless figure         i wished to go in that direction and to search the tor  but it       was some distance away  the baronet s nerves were still quivering       from that cry  which recalled the dark story of his family  and       he was not in the mood for fresh adventures  he had not seen this       lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his       strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me   a       warder  no doubt   said he   the moor has been thick with them       since this fellow escaped   well  perhaps his explanation may be       the right one  but i should like to have some further proof of       it  today we mean to communicate to the princetown people where       they should look for their missing man  but it is hard lines that       we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our       own prisoner  such are the adventures of last night  and you must       acknowledge  my dear holmes  that i have done you very well in       the matter of a report  much of what i tell you is no doubt quite       irrelevant  but still i feel that it is best that i should let       you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those       which will be of most service to you in helping you to your       conclusions  we are certainly making some progress  so far as the       barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions  and that       has cleared up the situation very much  but the moor with its       mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as       ever  perhaps in my next i may be able to throw some light upon       this also  best of all would it be if you could come down to us        in any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next       few days     chapter      extract from the diary of dr  watson        so far i have been able to quote from the reports which i have       forwarded during these early days to sherlock holmes  now        however  i have arrived at a point in my narrative where i am       compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my       recollections  aided by the diary which i kept at the time  a few       extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which       are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory  i proceed        then  from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the       convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor          october     th   a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain        the house is banked in with rolling clouds  which rise now and       then to show the dreary curves of the moor  with thin  silver       veins upon the sides of the hills  and the distant boulders       gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces  it is       melancholy outside and in  the baronet is in a black reaction       after the excitements of the night  i am conscious myself of a       weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger ever present       danger  which is the more terrible because i am unable to define       it         and have i not cause for such a feeling  consider the long       sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister       influence which is at work around us  there is the death of the       last occupant of the hall  fulfilling so exactly the conditions       of the family legend  and there are the repeated reports from       peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor        twice i have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the       distant baying of a hound  it is incredible  impossible  that it       should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature  a spectral       hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its       howling is surely not to be thought of  stapleton may fall in       with such a superstition  and mortimer also  but if i have one       quality upon earth it is common sense  and nothing will persuade       me to believe in such a thing  to do so would be to descend to       the level of these poor peasants  who are not content with a mere       fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell fire shooting       from his mouth and eyes  holmes would not listen to such fancies        and i am his agent  but facts are facts  and i have twice heard       this crying upon the moor  suppose that there were really some       huge hound loose upon it  that would go far to explain       everything  but where could such a hound lie concealed  where did       it get its food  where did it come from  how was it that no one       saw it by day  it must be confessed that the natural explanation       offers almost as many difficulties as the other  and always        apart from the hound  there is the fact of the human agency in       london  the man in the cab  and the letter which warned sir henry       against the moor  this at least was real  but it might have been       the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy  where       is that friend or enemy now  has he remained in london  or has he       followed us down here  could he could he be the stranger whom i       saw upon the tor         it is true that i have had only the one glance at him  and yet       there are some things to which i am ready to swear  he is no one       whom i have seen down here  and i have now met all the       neighbours  the figure was far taller than that of stapleton  far       thinner than that of frankland  barrymore it might possibly have       been  but we had left him behind us  and i am certain that he       could not have followed us  a stranger then is still dogging us        just as a stranger dogged us in london  we have never shaken him       off  if i could lay my hands upon that man  then at last we might       find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties  to this one       purpose i must now devote all my energies         my first impulse was to tell sir henry all my plans  my second       and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as       possible to anyone  he is silent and distrait  his nerves have       been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor  i will say       nothing to add to his anxieties  but i will take my own steps to       attain my own end         we had a small scene this morning after breakfast  barrymore       asked leave to speak with sir henry  and they were closeted in       his study some little time  sitting in the billiard room i more       than once heard the sound of voices raised  and i had a pretty       good idea what the point was which was under discussion  after a       time the baronet opened his door and called for me   barrymore       considers that he has a grievance   he said   he thinks that it       was unfair on our part to hunt his brother in law down when he        of his own free will  had told us the secret          the butler was standing very pale but very collected before us          i may have spoken too warmly  sir   said he   and if i have  i       am sure that i beg your pardon  at the same time  i was very much       surprised when i heard you two gentlemen come back this morning       and learned that you had been chasing selden  the poor fellow has       enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track           if you had told us of your own free will it would have been a       different thing   said the baronet   you only told us  or rather       your wife only told us  when it was forced from you and you could       not help yourself           i didn t think you would have taken advantage of it  sir       henry indeed i didn t           the man is a public danger  there are lonely houses scattered       over the moor  and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing  you       only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that  look at mr        stapleton s house  for example  with no one but himself to defend       it  there s no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key           he ll break into no house  sir  i give you my solemn word upon       that  but he will never trouble anyone in this country again  i       assure you  sir henry  that in a very few days the necessary       arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to       south america  for god s sake  sir  i beg of you not to let the       police know that he is still on the moor  they have given up the       chase there  and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for       him  you can t tell on him without getting my wife and me into       trouble  i beg you  sir  to say nothing to the police           what do you say  watson          i shrugged my shoulders   if he were safely out of the country it       would relieve the tax payer of a burden           but how about the chance of his holding someone up before he       goes           he would not do anything so mad  sir  we have provided him with       all that he can want  to commit a crime would be to show where he       was hiding           that is true   said sir henry   well  barrymore           god bless you  sir  and thank you from my heart  it would have       killed my poor wife had he been taken again           i guess we are aiding and abetting a felony  watson  but  after       what we have heard i don t feel as if i could give the man up  so       there is an end of it  all right  barrymore  you can go          with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned  but he       hesitated and then came back          you ve been so kind to us  sir  that i should like to do the       best i can for you in return  i know something  sir henry  and       perhaps i should have said it before  but it was long after the       inquest that i found it out  i ve never breathed a word about it       yet to mortal man  it s about poor sir charles s death          the baronet and i were both upon our feet   do you know how he       died           no  sir  i don t know that           what then           i know why he was at the gate at that hour  it was to meet a       woman           to meet a woman  he           yes  sir           and the woman s name           i can t give you the name  sir  but i can give you the initials        her initials were l  l           how do you know this  barrymore           well  sir henry  your uncle had a letter that morning  he had       usually a great many letters  for he was a public man and well       known for his kind heart  so that everyone who was in trouble was       glad to turn to him  but that morning  as it chanced  there was       only this one letter  so i took the more notice of it  it was       from coombe tracey  and it was addressed in a woman s hand           well           well  sir  i thought no more of the matter  and never would have       done had it not been for my wife  only a few weeks ago she was       cleaning out sir charles s study it had never been touched since       his death and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back       of the grate  the greater part of it was charred to pieces  but       one little slip  the end of a page  hung together  and the       writing could still be read  though it was grey on a black       ground  it seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the       letter and it said   please  please  as you are a gentleman  burn       this letter  and be at the gate by ten o clock  beneath it were       signed the initials l  l           have you got that slip           no  sir  it crumbled all to bits after we moved it           had sir charles received any other letters in the same writing           well  sir  i took no particular notice of his letters  i should       not have noticed this one  only it happened to come alone           and you have no idea who l  l  is           no  sir  no more than you have  but i expect if we could lay our       hands upon that lady we should know more about sir charles s       death           i cannot understand  barrymore  how you came to conceal this       important information           well  sir  it was immediately after that our own trouble came to       us  and then again  sir  we were both of us very fond of sir       charles  as we well might be considering all that he has done for       us  to rake this up couldn t help our poor master  and it s well       to go carefully when there s a lady in the case  even the best of       us           you thought it might injure his reputation           well  sir  i thought no good could come of it  but now you have       been kind to us  and i feel as if it would be treating you       unfairly not to tell you all that i know about the matter           very good  barrymore  you can go   when the butler had left us       sir henry turned to me   well  watson  what do you think of this       new light           it seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before           so i think  but if we can only trace l  l  it should clear up       the whole business  we have gained that much  we know that there       is someone who has the facts if we can only find her  what do you       think we should do           let holmes know all about it at once  it will give him the clue       for which he has been seeking  i am much mistaken if it does not       bring him down          i went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning s       conversation for holmes  it was evident to me that he had been       very busy of late  for the notes which i had from baker street       were few and short  with no comments upon the information which i       had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission  no doubt his       blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties  and yet this       new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his       interest  i wish that he were here          october     th   all day today the rain poured down  rustling on       the ivy and dripping from the eaves  i thought of the convict out       upon the bleak  cold  shelterless moor  poor devil  whatever his       crimes  he has suffered something to atone for them  and then i       thought of that other one the face in the cab  the figure against       the moon  was he also out in that deluged the unseen watcher  the       man of darkness  in the evening i put on my waterproof and i       walked far upon the sodden moor  full of dark imaginings  the       rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears        god help those who wander into the great mire now  for even the       firm uplands are becoming a morass  i found the black tor upon       which i had seen the solitary watcher  and from its craggy summit       i looked out myself across the melancholy downs  rain squalls       drifted across their russet face  and the heavy  slate coloured       clouds hung low over the landscape  trailing in grey wreaths down       the sides of the fantastic hills  in the distant hollow on the       left  half hidden by the mist  the two thin towers of baskerville       hall rose above the trees  they were the only signs of human life       which i could see  save only those prehistoric huts which lay       thickly upon the slopes of the hills  nowhere was there any trace       of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot two nights       before         as i walked back i was overtaken by dr  mortimer driving in his       dog cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying       farmhouse of foulmire  he has been very attentive to us  and       hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see       how we were getting on  he insisted upon my climbing into his       dog cart  and he gave me a lift homeward  i found him much       troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel  it had       wandered on to the moor and had never come back  i gave him such       consolation as i might  but i thought of the pony on the grimpen       mire  and i do not fancy that he will see his little dog again          by the way  mortimer   said i as we jolted along the rough road         i suppose there are few people living within driving distance of       this whom you do not know           hardly any  i think           can you  then  tell me the name of any woman whose initials are       l  l           he thought for a few minutes          no   said he   there are a few gipsies and labouring folk for       whom i can t answer  but among the farmers or gentry there is no       one whose initials are those  wait a bit though   he added after       a pause   there is laura lyons her initials are l  l  but she       lives in coombe tracey           who is she   i asked          she is frankland s daughter           what  old frankland the crank           exactly  she married an artist named lyons  who came sketching       on the moor  he proved to be a blackguard and deserted her  the       fault from what i hear may not have been entirely on one side        her father refused to have anything to do with her because she       had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other       reasons as well  so  between the old sinner and the young one the       girl has had a pretty bad time           how does she live           i fancy old frankland allows her a pittance  but it cannot be       more  for his own affairs are considerably involved  whatever she       may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the       bad  her story got about  and several of the people here did       something to enable her to earn an honest living  stapleton did       for one  and sir charles for another  i gave a trifle myself  it       was to set her up in a typewriting business          he wanted to know the object of my inquiries  but i managed to       satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much  for there is       no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence  tomorrow       morning i shall find my way to coombe tracey  and if i can see       this mrs  laura lyons  of equivocal reputation  a long step will       have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of       mysteries  i am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent        for when mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent       i asked him casually to what type frankland s skull belonged  and       so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive  i have       not lived for years with sherlock holmes for nothing         i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous       and melancholy day  this was my conversation with barrymore just       now  which gives me one more strong card which i can play in due       time         mortimer had stayed to dinner  and he and the baronet played        cart  afterwards  the butler brought me my coffee into the       library  and i took the chance to ask him a few questions          well   said i   has this precious relation of yours departed  or       is he still lurking out yonder           i don t know  sir  i hope to heaven that he has gone  for he has       brought nothing but trouble here  i ve not heard of him since i       left out food for him last  and that was three days ago           did you see him then           no  sir  but the food was gone when next i went that way           then he was certainly there           so you would think  sir  unless it was the other man who took       it          i sat with my coffee cup halfway to my lips and stared at       barrymore          you know that there is another man then           yes  sir  there is another man upon the moor           have you seen him           no  sir           how do you know of him then           selden told me of him  sir  a week ago or more  he s in hiding        too  but he s not a convict as far as i can make out  i don t       like it  dr  watson i tell you straight  sir  that i don t like       it   he spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness          now  listen to me  barrymore  i have no interest in this matter       but that of your master  i have come here with no object except       to help him  tell me  frankly  what it is that you don t like          barrymore hesitated for a moment  as if he regretted his outburst       or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words          it s all these goings on  sir   he cried at last  waving his       hand towards the rain lashed window which faced the moor         there s foul play somewhere  and there s black villainy brewing        to that i ll swear  very glad i should be  sir  to see sir henry       on his way back to london again           but what is it that alarms you           look at sir charles s death  that was bad enough  for all that       the coroner said  look at the noises on the moor at night        there s not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for       it  look at this stranger hiding out yonder  and watching and       waiting  what s he waiting for  what does it mean  it means no       good to anyone of the name of baskerville  and very glad i shall       be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henry s new servants       are ready to take over the hall           but about this stranger   said i   can you tell me anything       about him  what did selden say  did he find out where he hid  or       what he was doing           he saw him once or twice  but he is a deep one and gives nothing       away  at first he thought that he was the police  but soon he       found that he had some lay of his own  a kind of gentleman he       was  as far as he could see  but what he was doing he could not       make out           and where did he say that he lived           among the old houses on the hillside the stone huts where the       old folk used to live           but how about his food           selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and       brings all he needs  i dare say he goes to coombe tracey for what       he wants           very good  barrymore  we may talk further of this some other       time   when the butler had gone i walked over to the black       window  and i looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds       and at the tossing outline of the wind swept trees  it is a wild       night indoors  and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor        what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in       such a place at such a time  and what deep and earnest purpose       can he have which calls for such a trial  there  in that hut upon       the moor  seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has       vexed me so sorely  i swear that another day shall not have       passed before i have done all that man can do to reach the heart       of the mystery     chapter      the man on the tor        the extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter       has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of october  a time       when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their       terrible conclusion  the incidents of the next few days are       indelibly graven upon my recollection  and i can tell them       without reference to the notes made at the time  i start them       from the day which succeeded that upon which i had established       two facts of great importance  the one that mrs  laura lyons of       coombe tracey had written to sir charles baskerville and made an       appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his       death  the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be       found among the stone huts upon the hillside  with these two       facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my       courage must be deficient if i could not throw some further light       upon these dark places         i had no opportunity to tell the baronet what i had learned about       mrs  lyons upon the evening before  for dr  mortimer remained       with him at cards until it was very late  at breakfast  however        i informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would       care to accompany me to coombe tracey  at first he was very eager       to come  but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i       went alone the results might be better  the more formal we made       the visit the less information we might obtain  i left sir henry       behind  therefore  not without some prickings of conscience  and       drove off upon my new quest         when i reached coombe tracey i told perkins to put up the horses        and i made inquiries for the lady whom i had come to interrogate        i had no difficulty in finding her rooms  which were central and       well appointed  a maid showed me in without ceremony  and as i       entered the sitting room a lady  who was sitting before a       remington typewriter  sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome        her face fell  however  when she saw that i was a stranger  and       she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit         the first impression left by mrs  lyons was one of extreme       beauty  her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour  and       her cheeks  though considerably freckled  were flushed with the       exquisite bloom of the brunette  the dainty pink which lurks at       the heart of the sulphur rose  admiration was  i repeat  the       first impression  but the second was criticism  there was       something subtly wrong with the face  some coarseness of       expression  some hardness  perhaps  of eye  some looseness of lip       which marred its perfect beauty  but these  of course  are       afterthoughts  at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in       the presence of a very handsome woman  and that she was asking me       the reasons for my visit  i had not quite understood until that       instant how delicate my mission was          i have the pleasure   said i   of knowing your father          it was a clumsy introduction  and the lady made me feel it         there is nothing in common between my father and me   she said         i owe him nothing  and his friends are not mine  if it were not       for the late sir charles baskerville and some other kind hearts i       might have starved for all that my father cared           it was about the late sir charles baskerville that i have come       here to see you          the freckles started out on the lady s face          what can i tell you about him   she asked  and her fingers       played nervously over the stops of her typewriter          you knew him  did you not           i have already said that i owe a great deal to his kindness  if       i am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest       which he took in my unhappy situation           did you correspond with him          the lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes          what is the object of these questions   she asked sharply          the object is to avoid a public scandal  it is better that i       should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our       control          she was silent and her face was still very pale  at last she       looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner          well  i ll answer   she said   what are your questions           did you correspond with sir charles           i certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his       delicacy and his generosity           have you the dates of those letters           no           have you ever met him           yes  once or twice  when he came into coombe tracey  he was a       very retiring man  and he preferred to do good by stealth           but if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom  how did he       know enough about your affairs to be able to help you  as you say       that he has done          she met my difficulty with the utmost readiness          there were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united       to help me  one was mr  stapleton  a neighbour and intimate       friend of sir charles s  he was exceedingly kind  and it was       through him that sir charles learned about my affairs          i knew already that sir charles baskerville had made stapleton       his almoner upon several occasions  so the lady s statement bore       the impress of truth upon it          did you ever write to sir charles asking him to meet you   i       continued         mrs  lyons flushed with anger again   really  sir  this is a very       extraordinary question           i am sorry  madam  but i must repeat it           then i answer  certainly not           not on the very day of sir charles s death          the flush had faded in an instant  and a deathly face was before       me  her dry lips could not speak the  no  which i saw rather than       heard          surely your memory deceives you   said i   i could even quote a       passage of your letter  it ran  please  please  as you are a       gentleman  burn this letter  and be at the gate by ten o clock           i thought that she had fainted  but she recovered herself by a       supreme effort          is there no such thing as a gentleman   she gasped          you do sir charles an injustice  he  did  burn the letter  but       sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned  you       acknowledge now that you wrote it           yes  i did write it   she cried  pouring out her soul in a       torrent of words   i did write it  why should i deny it  i have       no reason to be ashamed of it  i wished him to help me  i       believed that if i had an interview i could gain his help  so i       asked him to meet me           but why at such an hour           because i had only just learned that he was going to london next       day and might be away for months  there were reasons why i could       not get there earlier           but why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the       house           do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor s       house           well  what happened when you did get there           i never went           mrs  lyons           no  i swear it to you on all i hold sacred  i never went        something intervened to prevent my going           what was that           that is a private matter  i cannot tell it           you acknowledge then that you made an appointment with sir       charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death  but       you deny that you kept the appointment           that is the truth          again and again i cross questioned her  but i could never get       past that point          mrs  lyons   said i as i rose from this long and inconclusive       interview   you are taking a very great responsibility and       putting yourself in a very false position by not making an       absolutely clean breast of all that you know  if i have to call       in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are       compromised  if your position is innocent  why did you in the       first instance deny having written to sir charles upon that       date           because i feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from       it and that i might find myself involved in a scandal           and why were you so pressing that sir charles should destroy       your letter           if you have read the letter you will know           i did not say that i had read all the letter           you quoted some of it           i quoted the postscript  the letter had  as i said  been burned       and it was not all legible  i ask you once again why it was that       you were so pressing that sir charles should destroy this letter       which he received on the day of his death           the matter is a very private one           the more reason why you should avoid a public investigation           i will tell you  then  if you have heard anything of my unhappy       history you will know that i made a rash marriage and had reason       to regret it           i have heard so much           my life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom i       abhor  the law is upon his side  and every day i am faced by the       possibility that he may force me to live with him  at the time       that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there       was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses       could be met  it meant everything to me peace of mind  happiness        self respect everything  i knew sir charles s generosity  and i       thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help       me           then how is it that you did not go           because i received help in the interval from another source           why then  did you not write to sir charles and explain this           so i should have done had i not seen his death in the paper next       morning          the woman s story hung coherently together  and all my questions       were unable to shake it  i could only check it by finding if she       had  indeed  instituted divorce proceedings against her husband       at or about the time of the tragedy         it was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been       to baskerville hall if she really had been  for a trap would be       necessary to take her there  and could not have returned to       coombe tracey until the early hours of the morning  such an       excursion could not be kept secret  the probability was        therefore  that she was telling the truth  or  at least  a part       of the truth  i came away baffled and disheartened  once again i       had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every       path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission  and yet       the more i thought of the lady s face and of her manner the more       i felt that something was being held back from me  why should she       turn so pale  why should she fight against every admission until       it was forced from her  why should she have been so reticent at       the time of the tragedy  surely the explanation of all this could       not be as innocent as she would have me believe  for the moment i       could proceed no farther in that direction  but must turn back to       that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts       upon the moor         and that was a most vague direction  i realised it as i drove       back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient       people  barrymore s only indication had been that the stranger       lived in one of these abandoned huts  and many hundreds of them       are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor  but       i had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man       himself standing upon the summit of the black tor  that  then        should be the centre of my search  from there i should explore       every hut upon the moor until i lighted upon the right one  if       this man were inside it i should find out from his own lips  at       the point of my revolver if necessary  who he was and why he had       dogged us so long  he might slip away from us in the crowd of       regent street  but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely       moor  on the other hand  if i should find the hut and its tenant       should not be within it i must remain there  however long the       vigil  until he returned  holmes had missed him in london  it       would indeed be a triumph for me if i could run him to earth       where my master had failed         luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry  but now       at last it came to my aid  and the messenger of good fortune was       none other than mr  frankland  who was standing  grey whiskered       and red faced  outside the gate of his garden  which opened on to       the highroad along which i travelled          good day  dr  watson   cried he with unwonted good humour   you       must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass       of wine and to congratulate me          my feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after       what i had heard of his treatment of his daughter  but i was       anxious to send perkins and the wagonette home  and the       opportunity was a good one  i alighted and sent a message to sir       henry that i should walk over in time for dinner  then i followed       frankland into his dining room          it is a great day for me  sir one of the red letter days of my       life   he cried with many chuckles   i have brought off a double       event  i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law  and       that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it  i have       established a right of way through the centre of old middleton s       park  slap across it  sir  within a hundred yards of his own       front door  what do you think of that  we ll teach these magnates       that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners        confound them  and i ve closed the wood where the fernworthy folk       used to picnic  these infernal people seem to think that there       are no rights of property  and that they can swarm where they       like with their papers and their bottles  both cases decided  dr        watson  and both in my favour  i haven t had such a day since i       had sir john morland for trespass because he shot in his own       warren           how on earth did you do that           look it up in the books  sir  it will repay reading frankland        v   morland  court of queen s bench  it cost me       but i got       my verdict           did it do you any good           none  sir  none  i am proud to say that i had no interest in the       matter  i act entirely from a sense of public duty  i have no       doubt  for example  that the fernworthy people will burn me in       effigy tonight  i told the police last time they did it that they       should stop these disgraceful exhibitions  the county       constabulary is in a scandalous state  sir  and it has not       afforded me the protection to which i am entitled  the case of       frankland  v   regina will bring the matter before the attention       of the public  i told them that they would have occasion to       regret their treatment of me  and already my words have come       true           how so   i asked         the old man put on a very knowing expression   because i could       tell them what they are dying to know  but nothing would induce       me to help the rascals in any way          i had been casting round for some excuse by which i could get       away from his gossip  but now i began to wish to hear more of it        i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to       understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest       way to stop his confidences          some poaching case  no doubt   said i with an indifferent       manner          ha  ha  my boy  a very much more important matter than that        what about the convict on the moor          i stared   you don t mean that you know where he is   said i          i may not know exactly where he is  but i am quite sure that i       could help the police to lay their hands on him  has it never       struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where       he got his food and so trace it to him          he certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth         no doubt   said i   but how do you know that he is anywhere upon       the moor           i know it because i have seen with my own eyes the messenger who       takes him his food          my heart sank for barrymore  it was a serious thing to be in the       power of this spiteful old busybody  but his next remark took a       weight from my mind          you ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a       child  i see him every day through my telescope upon the roof  he       passes along the same path at the same hour  and to whom should       he be going except to the convict          here was luck indeed  and yet i suppressed all appearance of       interest  a child  barrymore had said that our unknown was       supplied by a boy  it was on his track  and not upon the       convict s  that frankland had stumbled  if i could get his       knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt  but incredulity       and indifference were evidently my strongest cards          i should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of       one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father s dinner          the least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old       autocrat  his eyes looked malignantly at me  and his grey       whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat          indeed  sir   said he  pointing out over the wide stretching       moor   do you see that black tor over yonder  well  do you see       the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it  it is the       stoniest part of the whole moor  is that a place where a shepherd       would be likely to take his station  your suggestion  sir  is a       most absurd one          i meekly answered that i had spoken without knowing all the       facts  my submission pleased him and led him to further       confidences          you may be sure  sir  that i have very good grounds before i       come to an opinion  i have seen the boy again and again with his       bundle  every day  and sometimes twice a day  i have been       able but wait a moment  dr  watson  do my eyes deceive me  or is       there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside          it was several miles off  but i could distinctly see a small dark       dot against the dull green and grey          come  sir  come   cried frankland  rushing upstairs   you will       see with your own eyes and judge for yourself          the telescope  a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod        stood upon the flat leads of the house  frankland clapped his eye       to it and gave a cry of satisfaction          quick  dr  watson  quick  before he passes over the hill          there he was  sure enough  a small urchin with a little bundle       upon his shoulder  toiling slowly up the hill  when he reached       the crest i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant       against the cold blue sky  he looked round him with a furtive and       stealthy air  as one who dreads pursuit  then he vanished over       the hill          well  am i right           certainly  there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand           and what the errand is even a county constable could guess  but       not one word shall they have from me  and i bind you to secrecy       also  dr  watson  not a word  you understand           just as you wish           they have treated me shamefully shamefully  when the facts come       out in frankland  v   regina i venture to think that a thrill of       indignation will run through the country  nothing would induce me       to help the police in any way  for all they cared it might have       been me  instead of my effigy  which these rascals burned at the       stake  surely you are not going  you will help me to empty the       decanter in honour of this great occasion          but i resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading       him from his announced intention of walking home with me  i kept       the road as long as his eye was on me  and then i struck off       across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy       had disappeared  everything was working in my favour  and i swore       that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that       i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way         the sun was already sinking when i reached the summit of the       hill  and the long slopes beneath me were all golden green on one       side and grey shadow on the other  a haze lay low upon the       farthest sky line  out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of       belliver and vixen tor  over the wide expanse there was no sound       and no movement  one great grey bird  a gull or curlew  soared       aloft in the blue heaven  he and i seemed to be the only living       things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath       it  the barren scene  the sense of loneliness  and the mystery       and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart  the boy       was nowhere to be seen  but down beneath me in a cleft of the       hills there was a circle of the old stone huts  and in the middle       of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a       screen against the weather  my heart leaped within me as i saw       it  this must be the burrow where the stranger lurked  at last my       foot was on the threshold of his hiding place his secret was       within my grasp         as i approached the hut  walking as warily as stapleton would do       when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly  i       satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a       habitation  a vague pathway among the boulders led to the       dilapidated opening which served as a door  all was silent       within  the unknown might be lurking there  or he might be       prowling on the moor  my nerves tingled with the sense of       adventure  throwing aside my cigarette  i closed my hand upon the       butt of my revolver and  walking swiftly up to the door  i looked       in  the place was empty         but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false       scent  this was certainly where the man lived  some blankets       rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which       neolithic man had once slumbered  the ashes of a fire were heaped       in a rude grate  beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket       half full of water  a litter of empty tins showed that the place       had been occupied for some time  and i saw  as my eyes became       accustomed to the checkered light  a pannikin and a half full       bottle of spirits standing in the corner  in the middle of the       hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table  and upon this       stood a small cloth bundle the same  no doubt  which i had seen       through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy  it contained       a loaf of bread  a tinned tongue  and two tins of preserved       peaches  as i set it down again  after having examined it  my       heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper       with writing upon it  i raised it  and this was what i read        roughly scrawled in pencil   dr  watson has gone to coombe       tracey          for a minute i stood there with the paper in my hands thinking       out the meaning of this curt message  it was i  then  and not sir       henry  who was being dogged by this secret man  he had not       followed me himself  but he had set an agent the boy        perhaps upon my track  and this was his report  possibly i had       taken no step since i had been upon the moor which had not been       observed and reported  always there was this feeling of an unseen       force  a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and       delicacy  holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme       moment that one realised that one was indeed entangled in its       meshes         if there was one report there might be others  so i looked round       the hut in search of them  there was no trace  however  of       anything of the kind  nor could i discover any sign which might       indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this       singular place  save that he must be of spartan habits and cared       little for the comforts of life  when i thought of the heavy       rains and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and       immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that       inhospitable abode  was he our malignant enemy  or was he by       chance our guardian angel  i swore that i would not leave the hut       until i knew         outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with       scarlet and gold  its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches       by the distant pools which lay amid the great grimpen mire  there       were the two towers of baskerville hall  and there a distant blur       of smoke which marked the village of grimpen  between the two        behind the hill  was the house of the stapletons  all was sweet       and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light  and yet as i       looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of nature but       quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which       every instant was bringing nearer  with tingling nerves but a       fixed purpose  i sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited       with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant         and then at last i heard him  far away came the sharp clink of a       boot striking upon a stone  then another and yet another  coming       nearer and nearer  i shrank back into the darkest corner and       cocked the pistol in my pocket  determined not to discover myself       until i had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger        there was a long pause which showed that he had stopped  then       once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the       opening of the hut          it is a lovely evening  my dear watson   said a well known       voice   i really think that you will be more comfortable outside       than in      chapter      death on the moor        for a moment or two i sat breathless  hardly able to believe my       ears  then my senses and my voice came back to me  while a       crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be       lifted from my soul  that cold  incisive  ironical voice could       belong to but one man in all the world          holmes   i cried  holmes           come out   said he   and please be careful with the revolver          i stooped under the rude lintel  and there he sat upon a stone       outside  his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon       my astonished features  he was thin and worn  but clear and       alert  his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the       wind  in his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other       tourist upon the moor  and he had contrived  with that catlike       love of personal cleanliness which was one of his       characteristics  that his chin should be as smooth and his linen       as perfect as if he were in baker street          i never was more glad to see anyone in my life   said i as i       wrung him by the hand          or more astonished  eh           well  i must confess to it           the surprise was not all on one side  i assure you  i had no       idea that you had found my occasional retreat  still less that       you were inside it  until i was within twenty paces of the door           my footprint  i presume           no  watson  i fear that i could not undertake to recognize your       footprint amid all the footprints of the world  if you seriously       desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist  for when i       see the stub of a cigarette marked bradley  oxford street  i know       that my friend watson is in the neighbourhood  you will see it       there beside the path  you threw it down  no doubt  at that       supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut           exactly           i thought as much and knowing your admirable tenacity i was       convinced that you were sitting in ambush  a weapon within reach        waiting for the tenant to return  so you actually thought that i       was the criminal           i did not know who you were  but i was determined to find out           excellent  watson  and how did you localise me  you saw me        perhaps  on the night of the convict hunt  when i was so       imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me           yes  i saw you then           and have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this       one           no  your boy had been observed  and that gave me a guide where       to look           the old gentleman with the telescope  no doubt  i could not make       it out when first i saw the light flashing upon the lens   he       rose and peeped into the hut   ha  i see that cartwright has       brought up some supplies  what s this paper  so you have been to       coombe tracey  have you           yes           to see mrs  laura lyons           exactly           well done  our researches have evidently been running on       parallel lines  and when we unite our results i expect we shall       have a fairly full knowledge of the case           well  i am glad from my heart that you are here  for indeed the       responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my       nerves  but how in the name of wonder did you come here  and what       have you been doing  i thought that you were in baker street       working out that case of blackmailing           that was what i wished you to think           then you use me  and yet do not trust me   i cried with some       bitterness   i think that i have deserved better at your hands        holmes           my dear fellow  you have been invaluable to me in this as in       many other cases  and i beg that you will forgive me if i have       seemed to play a trick upon you  in truth  it was partly for your       own sake that i did it  and it was my appreciation of the danger       which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter       for myself  had i been with sir henry and you it is confident       that my point of view would have been the same as yours  and my       presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on       their guard  as it is  i have been able to get about as i could       not possibly have done had i been living in the hall  and i       remain an unknown factor in the business  ready to throw in all       my weight at a critical moment           but why keep me in the dark           for you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have       led to my discovery  you would have wished to tell me something        or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or       other  and so an unnecessary risk would be run  i brought       cartwright down with me you remember the little chap at the       express office and he has seen after my simple wants  a loaf of       bread and a clean collar  what does man want more  he has given       me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet  and       both have been invaluable           then my reports have all been wasted   my voice trembled as i       recalled the pains and the pride with which i had composed them         holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket          here are your reports  my dear fellow  and very well thumbed  i       assure you  i made excellent arrangements  and they are only       delayed one day upon their way  i must compliment you exceedingly       upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an       extraordinarily difficult case          i was still rather raw over the deception which had been       practised upon me  but the warmth of holmes s praise drove my       anger from my mind  i felt also in my heart that he was right in       what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that i       should not have known that he was upon the moor          that s better   said he  seeing the shadow rise from my face         and now tell me the result of your visit to mrs  laura lyons it       was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you       had gone  for i am already aware that she is the one person in       coombe tracey who might be of service to us in the matter  in       fact  if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that i       should have gone tomorrow          the sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor  the air had       turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth  there        sitting together in the twilight  i told holmes of my       conversation with the lady  so interested was he that i had to       repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied          this is most important   said he when i had concluded   it fills       up a gap which i had been unable to bridge in this most complex       affair  you are aware  perhaps  that a close intimacy exists       between this lady and the man stapleton           i did not know of a close intimacy           there can be no doubt about the matter  they meet  they write        there is a complete understanding between them  now  this puts a       very powerful weapon into our hands  if i could only use it to       detach his wife           his wife           i am giving you some information now  in return for all that you       have given me  the lady who has passed here as miss stapleton is       in reality his wife           good heavens  holmes  are you sure of what you say  how could he       have permitted sir henry to fall in love with her           sir henry s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except       sir henry  he took particular care that sir henry did not make       love to her  as you have yourself observed  i repeat that the       lady is his wife and not his sister           but why this elaborate deception           because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to       him in the character of a free woman          all my unspoken instincts  my vague suspicions  suddenly took       shape and centred upon the naturalist  in that impassive       colourless man  with his straw hat and his butterfly net  i       seemed to see something terrible a creature of infinite patience       and craft  with a smiling face and a murderous heart          it is he  then  who is our enemy it is he who dogged us in       london           so i read the riddle           and the warning it must have come from her           exactly          the shape of some monstrous villainy  half seen  half guessed        loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long          but are you sure of this  holmes  how do you know that the woman       is his wife           because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of       autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you  and i dare       say he has many a time regretted it since  he was once a       schoolmaster in the north of england  now  there is no one more       easy to trace than a schoolmaster  there are scholastic agencies       by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession        a little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief       under atrocious circumstances  and that the man who had owned       it the name was different had disappeared with his wife  the       descriptions agreed  when i learned that the missing man was       devoted to entomology the identification was complete          the darkness was rising  but much was still hidden by the       shadows          if this woman is in truth his wife  where does mrs  laura lyons       come in   i asked          that is one of the points upon which your own researches have       shed a light  your interview with the lady has cleared the       situation very much  i did not know about a projected divorce       between herself and her husband  in that case  regarding       stapleton as an unmarried man  she counted no doubt upon becoming       his wife           and when she is undeceived           why  then we may find the lady of service  it must be our first       duty to see her both of us tomorrow  don t you think  watson        that you are away from your charge rather long  your place should       be at baskerville hall          the last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had       settled upon the moor  a few faint stars were gleaming in a       violet sky          one last question  holmes   i said as i rose   surely there is       no need of secrecy between you and me  what is the meaning of it       all  what is he after          holmes s voice sank as he answered          it is murder  watson refined  cold blooded  deliberate murder        do not ask me for particulars  my nets are closing upon him  even       as his are upon sir henry  and with your help he is already       almost at my mercy  there is but one danger which can threaten       us  it is that he should strike before we are ready to do so        another day two at the most and i have my case complete  but       until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother       watched her ailing child  your mission today has justified       itself  and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his       side  hark          a terrible scream a prolonged yell of horror and anguish burst       out of the silence of the moor  that frightful cry turned the       blood to ice in my veins          oh  my god   i gasped   what is it  what does it mean          holmes had sprung to his feet  and i saw his dark  athletic       outline at the door of the hut  his shoulders stooping  his head       thrust forward  his face peering into the darkness          hush   he whispered   hush          the cry had been loud on account of its vehemence  but it had       pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain  now it       burst upon our ears  nearer  louder  more urgent than before          where is it   holmes whispered  and i knew from the thrill of       his voice that he  the man of iron  was shaken to the soul         where is it  watson           there  i think   i pointed into the darkness          no  there          again the agonised cry swept through the silent night  louder and       much nearer than ever  and a new sound mingled with it  a deep        muttered rumble  musical and yet menacing  rising and falling       like the low  constant murmur of the sea          the hound   cried holmes   come  watson  come  great heavens  if       we are too late          he had started running swiftly over the moor  and i had followed       at his heels  but now from somewhere among the broken ground       immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell        and then a dull  heavy thud  we halted and listened  not another       sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night         i saw holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted        he stamped his feet upon the ground          he has beaten us  watson  we are too late           no  no  surely not           fool that i was to hold my hand  and you  watson  see what comes       of abandoning your charge  but  by heaven  if the worst has       happened we ll avenge him          blindly we ran through the gloom  blundering against boulders        forcing our way through gorse bushes  panting up hills and       rushing down slopes  heading always in the direction whence those       dreadful sounds had come  at every rise holmes looked eagerly       round him  but the shadows were thick upon the moor  and nothing       moved upon its dreary face          can you see anything           nothing           but  hark  what is that          a low moan had fallen upon our ears  there it was again upon our       left  on that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which       overlooked a stone strewn slope  on its jagged face was       spread eagled some dark  irregular object  as we ran towards it       the vague outline hardened into a definite shape  it was a       prostrate man face downward upon the ground  the head doubled       under him at a horrible angle  the shoulders rounded and the body       hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault  so       grotesque was the attitude that i could not for the instant       realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul  not a       whisper  not a rustle  rose now from the dark figure over which       we stooped  holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again       with an exclamation of horror  the gleam of the match which he       struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool       which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim  and it       shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint       within us the body of sir henry baskerville         there was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar       ruddy tweed suit the very one which he had worn on the first       morning that we had seen him in baker street  we caught the one       clear glimpse of it  and then the match flickered and went out        even as the hope had gone out of our souls  holmes groaned  and       his face glimmered white through the darkness          the brute  the brute   i cried with clenched hands   oh holmes        i shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate           i am more to blame than you  watson  in order to have my case       well rounded and complete  i have thrown away the life of my       client  it is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my       career  but how could i know how  could  i know that he would       risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my       warnings           that we should have heard his screams my god  those screams  and       yet have been unable to save him  where is this brute of a hound       which drove him to his death  it may be lurking among these rocks       at this instant  and stapleton  where is he  he shall answer for       this deed           he shall  i will see to that  uncle and nephew have been       murdered the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast       which he thought to be supernatural  the other driven to his end       in his wild flight to escape from it  but now we have to prove       the connection between the man and the beast  save from what we       heard  we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter  since       sir henry has evidently died from the fall  but  by heavens        cunning as he is  the fellow shall be in my power before another       day is past          we stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body        overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had       brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end  then       as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which       our poor friend had fallen  and from the summit we gazed out over       the shadowy moor  half silver and half gloom  far away  miles       off  in the direction of grimpen  a single steady yellow light       was shining  it could only come from the lonely abode of the       stapletons  with a bitter curse i shook my fist at it as i gazed          why should we not seize him at once           our case is not complete  the fellow is wary and cunning to the       last degree  it is not what we know  but what we can prove  if we       make one false move the villain may escape us yet           what can we do           there will be plenty for us to do tomorrow  tonight we can only       perform the last offices to our poor friend          together we made our way down the precipitous slope and       approached the body  black and clear against the silvered stones        the agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain       and blurred my eyes with tears          we must send for help  holmes  we cannot carry him all the way       to the hall  good heavens  are you mad          he had uttered a cry and bent over the body  now he was dancing       and laughing and wringing my hand  could this be my stern        self contained friend  these were hidden fires  indeed          a beard  a beard  the man has a beard           a beard           it is not the baronet it is why  it is my neighbour  the       convict          with feverish haste we had turned the body over  and that       dripping beard was pointing up to the cold  clear moon  there       could be no doubt about the beetling forehead  the sunken animal       eyes  it was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the       light of the candle from over the rock the face of selden  the       criminal         then in an instant it was all clear to me  i remembered how the       baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to       barrymore  barrymore had passed it on in order to help selden in       his escape  boots  shirt  cap it was all sir henry s  the tragedy       was still black enough  but this man had at least deserved death       by the laws of his country  i told holmes how the matter stood        my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy          then the clothes have been the poor devil s death   said he   it       is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article       of sir henry s the boot which was abstracted in the hotel  in all       probability and so ran this man down  there is one very singular       thing  however  how came selden  in the darkness  to know that       the hound was on his trail           he heard him           to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like       this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk       recapture by screaming wildly for help  by his cries he must have       run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track  how did       he know           a greater mystery to me is why this hound  presuming that all       our conjectures are correct           i presume nothing           well  then  why this hound should be loose tonight  i suppose       that it does not always run loose upon the moor  stapleton would       not let it go unless he had reason to think that sir henry would       be there           my difficulty is the more formidable of the two  for i think       that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours  while       mine may remain forever a mystery  the question now is  what       shall we do with this poor wretch s body  we cannot leave it here       to the foxes and the ravens           i suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can       communicate with the police           exactly  i have no doubt that you and i could carry it so far        halloa  watson  what s this  it s the man himself  by all that s       wonderful and audacious  not a word to show your suspicions not a       word  or my plans crumble to the ground          a figure was approaching us over the moor  and i saw the dull red       glow of a cigar  the moon shone upon him  and i could distinguish       the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist  he stopped       when he saw us  and then came on again          why  dr  watson  that s not you  is it  you are the last man       that i should have expected to see out on the moor at this time       of night  but  dear me  what s this  somebody hurt  not don t       tell me that it is our friend sir henry   he hurried past me and       stooped over the dead man  i heard a sharp intake of his breath       and the cigar fell from his fingers          who who s this   he stammered          it is selden  the man who escaped from princetown          stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us  but by a supreme effort       he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment  he looked       sharply from holmes to me   dear me  what a very shocking affair        how did he die           he appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks        my friend and i were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry           i heard a cry also  that was what brought me out  i was uneasy       about sir henry           why about sir henry in particular   i could not help asking          because i had suggested that he should come over  when he did       not come i was surprised  and i naturally became alarmed for his       safety when i heard cries upon the moor  by the way  his eyes       darted again from my face to holmes s  did you hear anything else       besides a cry           no   said holmes   did you           no           what do you mean  then           oh  you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom       hound  and so on  it is said to be heard at night upon the moor        i was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound       tonight           we heard nothing of the kind   said i          and what is your theory of this poor fellow s death           i have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off       his head  he has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and       eventually fallen over here and broken his neck           that seems the most reasonable theory   said stapleton  and he       gave a sigh which i took to indicate his relief   what do you       think about it  mr  sherlock holmes          my friend bowed his compliments   you are quick at       identification   said he          we have been expecting you in these parts since dr  watson came       down  you are in time to see a tragedy           yes  indeed  i have no doubt that my friend s explanation will       cover the facts  i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to       london with me tomorrow           oh  you return tomorrow           that is my intention           i hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences       which have puzzled us          holmes shrugged his shoulders          one cannot always have the success for which one hopes  an       investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours  it has not       been a satisfactory case          my friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner        stapleton still looked hard at him  then he turned to me          i would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house  but it       would give my sister such a fright that i do not feel justified       in doing it  i think that if we put something over his face he       will be safe until morning          and so it was arranged  resisting stapleton s offer of       hospitality  holmes and i set off to baskerville hall  leaving       the naturalist to return alone  looking back we saw the figure       moving slowly away over the broad moor  and behind him that one       black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was       lying who had come so horribly to his end          we re at close grips at last   said holmes as we walked together       across the moor   what a nerve the fellow has  how he pulled       himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing       shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his       plot  i told you in london  watson  and i tell you now again        that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel           i am sorry that he has seen you           and so was i at first  but there was no getting out of it           what effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he       knows you are here           it may cause him to be more cautious  or it may drive him to       desperate measures at once  like most clever criminals  he may be       too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has       completely deceived us           why should we not arrest him at once           my dear watson  you were born to be a man of action  your       instinct is always to do something energetic  but supposing  for       argument s sake  that we had him arrested tonight  what on earth       the better off should we be for that  we could prove nothing       against him  there s the devilish cunning of it  if he were       acting through a human agent we could get some evidence  but if       we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not       help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master           surely we have a case           not a shadow of one only surmise and conjecture  we should be       laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such       evidence           there is sir charles s death           found dead without a mark upon him  you and i know that he died       of sheer fright  and we know also what frightened him  but how       are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it  what signs are       there of a hound  where are the marks of its fangs  of course we       know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that sir charles       was dead before ever the brute overtook him  but we have to prove       all this  and we are not in a position to do it           well  then  tonight           we are not much better off tonight  again  there was no direct       connection between the hound and the man s death  we never saw       the hound  we heard it  but we could not prove that it was       running upon this man s trail  there is a complete absence of       motive  no  my dear fellow  we must reconcile ourselves to the       fact that we have no case at present  and that it is worth our       while to run any risk in order to establish one           and how do you propose to do so           i have great hopes of what mrs  laura lyons may do for us when       the position of affairs is made clear to her  and i have my own       plan as well  sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof  but i       hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last          i could draw nothing further from him  and he walked  lost in       thought  as far as the baskerville gates          are you coming up           yes  i see no reason for further concealment  but one last word        watson  say nothing of the hound to sir henry  let him think that       selden s death was as stapleton would have us believe  he will       have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo       tomorrow  when he is engaged  if i remember your report aright        to dine with these people           and so am i           then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone  that will be       easily arranged  and now  if we are too late for dinner  i think       that we are both ready for our suppers      chapter      fixing the nets        sir henry was more pleased than surprised to see sherlock holmes        for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would       bring him down from london  he did raise his eyebrows  however        when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any       explanations for its absence  between us we soon supplied his       wants  and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet       as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should       know  but first i had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to       barrymore and his wife  to him it may have been an unmitigated       relief  but she wept bitterly in her apron  to all the world he       was the man of violence  half animal and half demon  but to her       he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood  the       child who had clung to her hand  evil indeed is the man who has       not one woman to mourn him          i ve been moping in the house all day since watson went off in       the morning   said the baronet   i guess i should have some       credit  for i have kept my promise  if i hadn t sworn not to go       about alone i might have had a more lively evening  for i had a       message from stapleton asking me over there           i have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening         said holmes drily   by the way  i don t suppose you appreciate       that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck          sir henry opened his eyes   how was that           this poor wretch was dressed in your clothes  i fear your       servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the       police           that is unlikely  there was no mark on any of them  as far as i       know           that s lucky for him in fact  it s lucky for all of you  since       you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter  i am not       sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to       arrest the whole household  watson s reports are most       incriminating documents           but how about the case   asked the baronet   have you made       anything out of the tangle  i don t know that watson and i are       much the wiser since we came down           i think that i shall be in a position to make the situation       rather more clear to you before long  it has been an exceedingly       difficult and most complicated business  there are several points       upon which we still want light but it is coming all the same           we ve had one experience  as watson has no doubt told you  we       heard the hound on the moor  so i can swear that it is not all       empty superstition  i had something to do with dogs when i was       out west  and i know one when i hear one  if you can muzzle that       one and put him on a chain i ll be ready to swear you are the       greatest detective of all time           i think i will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will       give me your help           whatever you tell me to do i will do           very good  and i will ask you also to do it blindly  without       always asking the reason           just as you like           if you will do this i think the chances are that our little       problem will soon be solved  i have no doubt          he stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the       air  the lamp beat upon his face  and so intent was it and so       still that it might have been that of a clear cut classical       statue  a personification of alertness and expectation          what is it   we both cried         i could see as he looked down that he was repressing some       internal emotion  his features were still composed  but his eyes       shone with amused exultation          excuse the admiration of a connoisseur   said he as he waved his       hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite       wall   watson won t allow that i know anything of art but that is       mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ  now        these are a really very fine series of portraits           well  i m glad to hear you say so   said sir henry  glancing       with some surprise at my friend   i don t pretend to know much       about these things  and i d be a better judge of a horse or a       steer than of a picture  i didn t know that you found time for       such things           i know what is good when i see it  and i see it now  that s a       kneller  i ll swear  that lady in the blue silk over yonder  and       the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a reynolds  they are       all family portraits  i presume           every one           do you know the names           barrymore has been coaching me in them  and i think i can say my       lessons fairly well           who is the gentleman with the telescope           that is rear admiral baskerville  who served under rodney in the       west indies  the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is       sir william baskerville  who was chairman of committees of the       house of commons under pitt           and this cavalier opposite to me the one with the black velvet       and the lace           ah  you have a right to know about him  that is the cause of all       the mischief  the wicked hugo  who started the hound of the       baskervilles  we re not likely to forget him          i gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait          dear me   said holmes   he seems a quiet  meek mannered man       enough  but i dare say that there was a lurking devil in his       eyes  i had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person           there s no doubt about the authenticity  for the name and the       date        are on the back of the canvas          holmes said little more  but the picture of the old roysterer       seemed to have a fascination for him  and his eyes were       continually fixed upon it during supper  it was not until later        when sir henry had gone to his room  that i was able to follow       the trend of his thoughts  he led me back into the       banqueting hall  his bedroom candle in his hand  and he held it       up against the time stained portrait on the wall          do you see anything there          i looked at the broad plumed hat  the curling love locks  the       white lace collar  and the straight  severe face which was framed       between them  it was not a brutal countenance  but it was prim        hard  and stern  with a firm set  thin lipped mouth  and a coldly       intolerant eye          is it like anyone you know           there is something of sir henry about the jaw           just a suggestion  perhaps  but wait an instant   he stood upon       a chair  and  holding up the light in his left hand  he curved       his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets          good heavens   i cried in amazement         the face of stapleton had sprung out of the canvas          ha  you see it now  my eyes have been trained to examine faces       and not their trimmings  it is the first quality of a criminal       investigator that he should see through a disguise           but this is marvellous  it might be his portrait           yes  it is an interesting instance of a throwback  which appears       to be both physical and spiritual  a study of family portraits is       enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation  the       fellow is a baskerville that is evident           with designs upon the succession           exactly  this chance of the picture has supplied us with one of       our most obvious missing links  we have him  watson  we have him        and i dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering       in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies  a pin  a       cork  and a card  and we add him to the baker street collection         he burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away       from the picture  i have not heard him laugh often  and it has       always boded ill to somebody         i was up betimes in the morning  but holmes was afoot earlier       still  for i saw him as i dressed  coming up the drive          yes  we should have a full day today   he remarked  and he       rubbed his hands with the joy of action   the nets are all in       place  and the drag is about to begin  we ll know before the day       is out whether we have caught our big  lean jawed pike  or       whether he has got through the meshes           have you been on the moor already           i have sent a report from grimpen to princetown as to the death       of selden  i think i can promise that none of you will be       troubled in the matter  and i have also communicated with my       faithful cartwright  who would certainly have pined away at the       door of my hut  as a dog does at his master s grave  if i had not       set his mind at rest about my safety           what is the next move           to see sir henry  ah  here he is           good morning  holmes   said the baronet   you look like a       general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff           that is the exact situation  watson was asking for orders           and so do i           very good  you are engaged  as i understand  to dine with our       friends the stapletons tonight           i hope that you will come also  they are very hospitable people        and i am sure that they would be very glad to see you           i fear that watson and i must go to london           to london           yes  i think that we should be more useful there at the present       juncture          the baronet s face perceptibly lengthened          i hoped that you were going to see me through this business  the       hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is       alone           my dear fellow  you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what       i tell you  you can tell your friends that we should have been       happy to have come with you  but that urgent business required us       to be in town  we hope very soon to return to devonshire  will       you remember to give them that message           if you insist upon it           there is no alternative  i assure you          i saw by the baronet s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by       what he regarded as our desertion          when do you desire to go   he asked coldly          immediately after breakfast  we will drive in to coombe tracey        but watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come       back to you  watson  you will send a note to stapleton to tell       him that you regret that you cannot come           i have a good mind to go to london with you   said the baronet         why should i stay here alone           because it is your post of duty  because you gave me your word       that you would do as you were told  and i tell you to stay           all right  then  i ll stay           one more direction  i wish you to drive to merripit house  send       back your trap  however  and let them know that you intend to       walk home           to walk across the moor           yes           but that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me       not to do           this time you may do it with safety  if i had not every       confidence in your nerve and courage i would not suggest it  but       it is essential that you should do it           then i will do it           and as you value your life do not go across the moor in any       direction save along the straight path which leads from merripit       house to the grimpen road  and is your natural way home           i will do just what you say           very good  i should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast       as possible  so as to reach london in the afternoon          i was much astounded by this programme  though i remembered that       holmes had said to stapleton on the night before that his visit       would terminate next day  it had not crossed my mind however        that he would wish me to go with him  nor could i understand how       we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to       be critical  there was nothing for it  however  but implicit       obedience  so we bade good bye to our rueful friend  and a couple       of hours afterwards we were at the station of coombe tracey and       had dispatched the trap upon its return journey  a small boy was       waiting upon the platform          any orders  sir           you will take this train to town  cartwright  the moment you       arrive you will send a wire to sir henry baskerville  in my name        to say that if he finds the pocketbook which i have dropped he is       to send it by registered post to baker street           yes  sir           and ask at the station office if there is a message for me          the boy returned with a telegram  which holmes handed to me  it       ran         wire received  coming down with unsigned warrant  arrive       five forty  lestrade          that is in answer to mine of this morning  he is the best of the       professionals  i think  and we may need his assistance  now        watson  i think that we cannot employ our time better than by       calling upon your acquaintance  mrs  laura lyons          his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident  he would use       the baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were       really gone  while we should actually return at the instant when       we were likely to be needed  that telegram from london  if       mentioned by sir henry to the stapletons  must remove the last       suspicions from their minds  already i seemed to see our nets       drawing closer around that lean jawed pike         mrs  laura lyons was in her office  and sherlock holmes opened       his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably       amazed her          i am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of       the late sir charles baskerville   said he   my friend here  dr        watson  has informed me of what you have communicated  and also       of what you have withheld in connection with that matter           what have i withheld   she asked defiantly          you have confessed that you asked sir charles to be at the gate       at ten o clock  we know that that was the place and hour of his       death  you have withheld what the connection is between these       events           there is no connection           in that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary       one  but i think that we shall succeed in establishing a       connection  after all  i wish to be perfectly frank with you        mrs  lyons  we regard this case as one of murder  and the       evidence may implicate not only your friend mr  stapleton but his       wife as well          the lady sprang from her chair          his wife   she cried          the fact is no longer a secret  the person who has passed for       his sister is really his wife          mrs  lyons had resumed her seat  her hands were grasping the arms       of her chair  and i saw that the pink nails had turned white with       the pressure of her grip          his wife   she said again   his wife  he is not a married man          sherlock holmes shrugged his shoulders          prove it to me  prove it to me  and if you can do so           the fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words          i have come prepared to do so   said holmes  drawing several       papers from his pocket   here is a photograph of the couple taken       in york four years ago  it is indorsed  mr  and mrs  vandeleur         but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him  and her also        if you know her by sight  here are three written descriptions by       trustworthy witnesses of mr  and mrs  vandeleur  who at that time       kept st  oliver s private school  read them and see if you can       doubt the identity of these people          she glanced at them  and then looked up at us with the set  rigid       face of a desperate woman          mr  holmes   she said   this man had offered me marriage on       condition that i could get a divorce from my husband  he has lied       to me  the villain  in every conceivable way  not one word of       truth has he ever told me  and why why  i imagined that all was       for my own sake  but now i see that i was never anything but a       tool in his hands  why should i preserve faith with him who never       kept any with me  why should i try to shield him from the       consequences of his own wicked acts  ask me what you like  and       there is nothing which i shall hold back  one thing i swear to       you  and that is that when i wrote the letter i never dreamed of       any harm to the old gentleman  who had been my kindest friend           i entirely believe you  madam   said sherlock holmes   the       recital of these events must be very painful to you  and perhaps       it will make it easier if i tell you what occurred  and you can       check me if i make any material mistake  the sending of this       letter was suggested to you by stapleton           he dictated it           i presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive       help from sir charles for the legal expenses connected with your       divorce           exactly           and then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from       keeping the appointment           he told me that it would hurt his self respect that any other       man should find the money for such an object  and that though he       was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing       the obstacles which divided us           he appears to be a very consistent character  and then you heard       nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper           no           and he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with       sir charles           he did  he said that the death was a very mysterious one  and       that i should certainly be suspected if the facts came out  he       frightened me into remaining silent           quite so  but you had your suspicions          she hesitated and looked down          i knew him   she said   but if he had kept faith with me i       should always have done so with him           i think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape   said       sherlock holmes   you have had him in your power and he knew it        and yet you are alive  you have been walking for some months very       near to the edge of a precipice  we must wish you good morning       now  mrs  lyons  and it is probable that you will very shortly       hear from us again           our case becomes rounded off  and difficulty after difficulty       thins away in front of us   said holmes as we stood waiting for       the arrival of the express from town   i shall soon be in the       position of being able to put into a single connected narrative       one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times        students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in       godno  in little russia  in the year      and of course there are       the anderson murders in north carolina  but this case possesses       some features which are entirely its own  even now we have no       clear case against this very wily man  but i shall be very much       surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this       night          the london express came roaring into the station  and a small        wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first class carriage  we       all three shook hands  and i saw at once from the reverential way       in which lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a       good deal since the days when they had first worked together  i       could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner       used then to excite in the practical man          anything good   he asked          the biggest thing for years   said holmes   we have two hours       before we need think of starting  i think we might employ it in       getting some dinner and then  lestrade  we will take the london       fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night       air of dartmoor  never been there  ah  well  i don t suppose you       will forget your first visit      chapter      the hound of the baskervilles        one of sherlock holmes s defects if  indeed  one may call it a       defect was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full       plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment        partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature  which       loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him  partly       also from his professional caution  which urged him never to take       any chances  the result  however  was very trying for those who       were acting as his agents and assistants  i had often suffered       under it  but never more so than during that long drive in the       darkness  the great ordeal was in front of us  at last we were       about to make our final effort  and yet holmes had said nothing        and i could only surmise what his course of action would be  my       nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon       our faces and the dark  void spaces on either side of the narrow       road told me that we were back upon the moor once again  every       stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us       nearer to our supreme adventure         our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of       the hired wagonette  so that we were forced to talk of trivial       matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation        it was a relief to me  after that unnatural restraint  when we at       last passed frankland s house and knew that we were drawing near       to the hall and to the scene of action  we did not drive up to       the door but got down near the gate of the avenue  the wagonette       was paid off and ordered to return to coombe tracey forthwith        while we started to walk to merripit house          are you armed  lestrade          the little detective smiled   as long as i have my trousers i       have a hip pocket  and as long as i have my hip pocket i have       something in it           good  my friend and i are also ready for emergencies           you re mighty close about this affair  mr  holmes  what s the       game now           a waiting game           my word  it does not seem a very cheerful place   said the       detective with a shiver  glancing round him at the gloomy slopes       of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the       grimpen mire   i see the lights of a house ahead of us           that is merripit house and the end of our journey  i must       request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper          we moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the       house  but holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards       from it          this will do   said he   these rocks upon the right make an       admirable screen           we are to wait here           yes  we shall make our little ambush here  get into this hollow        lestrade  you have been inside the house  have you not  watson        can you tell the position of the rooms  what are those latticed       windows at this end           i think they are the kitchen windows           and the one beyond  which shines so brightly           that is certainly the dining room           the blinds are up  you know the lie of the land best  creep       forward quietly and see what they are doing but for heaven s sake       don t let them know that they are watched          i tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which       surrounded the stunted orchard  creeping in its shadow i reached       a point whence i could look straight through the uncurtained       window         there were only two men in the room  sir henry and stapleton        they sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the       round table  both of them were smoking cigars  and coffee and       wine were in front of them  stapleton was talking with animation        but the baronet looked pale and distrait  perhaps the thought of       that lonely walk across the ill omened moor was weighing heavily       upon his mind         as i watched them stapleton rose and left the room  while sir       henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair        puffing at his cigar  i heard the creak of a door and the crisp       sound of boots upon gravel  the steps passed along the path on       the other side of the wall under which i crouched  looking over        i saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out house in the       corner of the orchard  a key turned in a lock  and as he passed       in there was a curious scuffling noise from within  he was only a       minute or so inside  and then i heard the key turn once more and       he passed me and reentered the house  i saw him rejoin his guest        and i crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to       tell them what i had seen          you say  watson  that the lady is not there   holmes asked when       i had finished my report          no           where can she be  then  since there is no light in any other       room except the kitchen           i cannot think where she is          i have said that over the great grimpen mire there hung a dense        white fog  it was drifting slowly in our direction and banked       itself up like a wall on that side of us  low but thick and well       defined  the moon shone on it  and it looked like a great       shimmering ice field  with the heads of the distant tors as rocks       borne upon its surface  holmes s face was turned towards it  and       he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift          it s moving towards us  watson           is that serious           very serious  indeed the one thing upon earth which could have       disarranged my plans  he can t be very long  now  it is already       ten o clock  our success and even his life may depend upon his       coming out before the fog is over the path          the night was clear and fine above us  the stars shone cold and       bright  while a half moon bathed the whole scene in a soft        uncertain light  before us lay the dark bulk of the house  its       serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the       silver spangled sky  broad bars of golden light from the lower       windows stretched across the orchard and the moor  one of them       was suddenly shut off  the servants had left the kitchen  there       only remained the lamp in the dining room where the two men  the       murderous host and the unconscious guest  still chatted over       their cigars         every minute that white woolly plain which covered one half of       the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house  already the       first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of       the lighted window  the farther wall of the orchard was already       invisible  and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white       vapour  as we watched it the fog wreaths came crawling round both       corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on       which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship       upon a shadowy sea  holmes struck his hand passionately upon the       rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience          if he isn t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be       covered  in half an hour we won t be able to see our hands in       front of us           shall we move farther back upon higher ground           yes  i think it would be as well          so as the fog bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we       were half a mile from the house  and still that dense white sea        with the moon silvering its upper edge  swept slowly and       inexorably on          we are going too far   said holmes   we dare not take the chance       of his being overtaken before he can reach us  at all costs we       must hold our ground where we are   he dropped on his knees and       clapped his ear to the ground   thank god  i think that i hear       him coming          a sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor  crouching       among the stones we stared intently at the silver tipped bank in       front of us  the steps grew louder  and through the fog  as       through a curtain  there stepped the man whom we were awaiting        he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear        starlit night  then he came swiftly along the path  passed close       to where we lay  and went on up the long slope behind us  as he       walked he glanced continually over either shoulder  like a man       who is ill at ease          hist   cried holmes  and i heard the sharp click of a cocking       pistol   look out  it s coming          there was a thin  crisp  continuous patter from somewhere in the       heart of that crawling bank  the cloud was within fifty yards of       where we lay  and we glared at it  all three  uncertain what       horror was about to break from the heart of it  i was at holmes s       elbow  and i glanced for an instant at his face  it was pale and       exultant  his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight  but       suddenly they started forward in a rigid  fixed stare  and his       lips parted in amazement  at the same instant lestrade gave a       yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground  i       sprang to my feet  my inert hand grasping my pistol  my mind       paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from       the shadows of the fog  a hound it was  an enormous coal black       hound  but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen  fire       burst from its open mouth  its eyes glowed with a smouldering       glare  its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in       flickering flame  never in the delirious dream of a disordered       brain could anything more savage  more appalling  more hellish be       conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us       out of the wall of fog         with long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the       track  following hard upon the footsteps of our friend  so       paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass       before we had recovered our nerve  then holmes and i both fired       together  and the creature gave a hideous howl  which showed that       one at least had hit him  he did not pause  however  but bounded       onward  far away on the path we saw sir henry looking back  his       face white in the moonlight  his hands raised in horror  glaring       helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down  but       that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the       winds  if he was vulnerable he was mortal  and if we could wound       him we could kill him  never have i seen a man run as holmes ran       that night  i am reckoned fleet of foot  but he outpaced me as       much as i outpaced the little professional  in front of us as we       flew up the track we heard scream after scream from sir henry and       the deep roar of the hound  i was in time to see the beast spring       upon its victim  hurl him to the ground  and worry at his throat        but the next instant holmes had emptied five barrels of his       revolver into the creature s flank  with a last howl of agony and       a vicious snap in the air  it rolled upon its back  four feet       pawing furiously  and then fell limp upon its side  i stooped        panting  and pressed my pistol to the dreadful  shimmering head        but it was useless to press the trigger  the giant hound was       dead         sir henry lay insensible where he had fallen  we tore away his       collar  and holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw       that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in       time  already our friend s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble       effort to move  lestrade thrust his brandy flask between the       baronet s teeth  and two frightened eyes were looking up at us          my god   he whispered   what was it  what  in heaven s name  was       it           it s dead  whatever it is   said holmes   we ve laid the family       ghost once and forever          in mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was       lying stretched before us  it was not a pure bloodhound and it       was not a pure mastiff  but it appeared to be a combination of       the two gaunt  savage  and as large as a small lioness  even now       in the stillness of death  the huge jaws seemed to be dripping       with a bluish flame and the small  deep set  cruel eyes were       ringed with fire  i placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle  and       as i held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the       darkness          phosphorus   i said          a cunning preparation of it   said holmes  sniffing at the dead       animal   there is no smell which might have interfered with his       power of scent  we owe you a deep apology  sir henry  for having       exposed you to this fright  i was prepared for a hound  but not       for such a creature as this  and the fog gave us little time to       receive him           you have saved my life           having first endangered it  are you strong enough to stand           give me another mouthful of that brandy and i shall be ready for       anything  so  now  if you will help me up  what do you propose to       do           to leave you here  you are not fit for further adventures       tonight  if you will wait  one or other of us will go back with       you to the hall          he tried to stagger to his feet  but he was still ghastly pale       and trembling in every limb  we helped him to a rock  where he       sat shivering with his face buried in his hands          we must leave you now   said holmes   the rest of our work must       be done  and every moment is of importance  we have our case  and       now we only want our man          it s a thousand to one against our finding him at the house   he       continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path   those       shots must have told him that the game was up           we were some distance off  and this fog may have deadened them           he followed the hound to call him off of that you may be       certain  no  no  he s gone by this time  but we ll search the       house and make sure          the front door was open  so we rushed in and hurried from room to       room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant  who met us       in the passage  there was no light save in the dining room  but       holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house       unexplored  no sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing        on the upper floor  however  one of the bedroom doors was locked          there s someone in here   cried lestrade   i can hear a       movement  open this door          a faint moaning and rustling came from within  holmes struck the       door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew       open  pistol in hand  we all three rushed into the room         but there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant       villain whom we expected to see  instead we were faced by an       object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment       staring at it in amazement         the room had been fashioned into a small museum  and the walls       were lined by a number of glass topped cases full of that       collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had       been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man  in the       centre of this room there was an upright beam  which had been       placed at some period as a support for the old worm eaten baulk       of timber which spanned the roof  to this post a figure was tied        so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to       secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was       that of a man or a woman  one towel passed round the throat and       was secured at the back of the pillar  another covered the lower       part of the face  and over it two dark eyes eyes full of grief       and shame and a dreadful questioning stared back at us  in a       minute we had torn off the gag  unswathed the bonds  and mrs        stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us  as her beautiful       head fell upon her chest i saw the clear red weal of a whiplash       across her neck          the brute   cried holmes   here  lestrade  your brandy bottle        put her in the chair  she has fainted from ill usage and       exhaustion          she opened her eyes again          is he safe   she asked   has he escaped           he cannot escape us  madam           no  no  i did not mean my husband  sir henry  is he safe           yes           and the hound           it is dead          she gave a long sigh of satisfaction          thank god  thank god  oh  this villain  see how he has treated       me   she shot her arms out from her sleeves  and we saw with       horror that they were all mottled with bruises   but this is       nothing nothing  it is my mind and soul that he has tortured and       defiled  i could endure it all  ill usage  solitude  a life of       deception  everything  as long as i could still cling to the hope       that i had his love  but now i know that in this also i have been       his dupe and his tool   she broke into passionate sobbing as she       spoke          you bear him no good will  madam   said holmes   tell us then       where we shall find him  if you have ever aided him in evil  help       us now and so atone           there is but one place where he can have fled   she answered         there is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire        it was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made       preparations so that he might have a refuge  that is where he       would fly          the fog bank lay like white wool against the window  holmes held       the lamp towards it          see   said he   no one could find his way into the grimpen mire       tonight          she laughed and clapped her hands  her eyes and teeth gleamed       with fierce merriment          he may find his way in  but never out   she cried   how can he       see the guiding wands tonight  we planted them together  he and       i  to mark the pathway through the mire  oh  if i could only have       plucked them out today  then indeed you would have had him at       your mercy          it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog       had lifted  meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house       while holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville       hall  the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld       from him  but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth       about the woman whom he had loved  but the shock of the night s       adventures had shattered his nerves  and before morning he lay       delirious in a high fever under the care of dr  mortimer  the two       of them were destined to travel together round the world before       sir henry had become once more the hale  hearty man that he had       been before he became master of that ill omened estate         and now i come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular       narrative  in which i have tried to make the reader share those       dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and       ended in so tragic a manner  on the morning after the death of       the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by mrs  stapleton       to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog  it       helped us to realise the horror of this woman s life when we saw       the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband s       track  we left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm        peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog  from the       end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the       path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those       green scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the       stranger  rank reeds and lush  slimy water plants sent an odour       of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces  while a       false step plunged us more than once thigh deep into the dark        quivering mire  which shook for yards in soft undulations around       our feet  its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked        and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was       tugging us down into those obscene depths  so grim and purposeful       was the clutch in which it held us  once only we saw a trace that       someone had passed that perilous way before us  from amid a tuft       of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing       was projecting  holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the       path to seize it  and had we not been there to drag him out he       could never have set his foot upon firm land again  he held an       old black boot in the air   meyers  toronto   was printed on the       leather inside          it is worth a mud bath   said he   it is our friend sir henry s       missing boot           thrown there by stapleton in his flight           exactly  he retained it in his hand after using it to set the       hound upon the track  he fled when he knew the game was up  still       clutching it  and he hurled it away at this point of his flight        we know at least that he came so far in safety          but more than that we were never destined to know  though there       was much which we might surmise  there was no chance of finding       footsteps in the mire  for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon       them  but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass       we all looked eagerly for them  but no slightest sign of them       ever met our eyes  if the earth told a true story  then stapleton       never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled       through the fog upon that last night  somewhere in the heart of       the great grimpen mire  down in the foul slime of the huge morass       which had sucked him in  this cold and cruel hearted man is       forever buried         many traces we found of him in the bog girt island where he had       hid his savage ally  a huge driving wheel and a shaft half filled       with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine  beside it       were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners  driven       away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp  in one       of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones       showed where the animal had been confined  a skeleton with a       tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the  d bris           a dog   said holmes   by jove  a curly haired spaniel  poor       mortimer will never see his pet again  well  i do not know that       this place contains any secret which we have not already       fathomed  he could hide his hound  but he could not hush its       voice  and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not       pleasant to hear  on an emergency he could keep the hound in the       out house at merripit  but it was always a risk  and it was only       on the supreme day  which he regarded as the end of all his       efforts  that he dared do it  this paste in the tin is no doubt       the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed  it was       suggested  of course  by the story of the family hell hound  and       by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death  no wonder the       poor devil of a convict ran and screamed  even as our friend did        and as we ourselves might have done  when he saw such a creature       bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track  it was       a cunning device  for  apart from the chance of driving your       victim to his death  what peasant would venture to inquire too       closely into such a creature should he get sight of it  as many       have done  upon the moor  i said it in london  watson  and i say       it again now  that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more       dangerous man than he who is lying yonder  he swept his long arm       towards the huge mottled expanse of green splotched bog which       stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the       moor     chapter      a retrospection        it was the end of november  and holmes and i sat  upon a raw and       foggy night  on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting room       in baker street  since the tragic upshot of our visit to       devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost       importance  in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious       conduct of colonel upwood in connection with the famous card       scandal of the nonpareil club  while in the second he had       defended the unfortunate mme  montpensier from the charge of       murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her       step daughter  mlle  car re  the young lady who  as it will be       remembered  was found six months later alive and married in new       york  my friend was in excellent spirits over the success which       had attended a succession of difficult and important cases  so       that i was able to induce him to discuss the details of the       baskerville mystery  i had waited patiently for the opportunity       for i was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap  and       that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its       present work to dwell upon memories of the past  sir henry and       dr  mortimer were  however  in london  on their way to that long       voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his       shattered nerves  they had called upon us that very afternoon  so       that it was natural that the subject should come up for       discussion          the whole course of events   said holmes   from the point of       view of the man who called himself stapleton was simple and       direct  although to us  who had no means in the beginning of       knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of       the facts  it all appeared exceedingly complex  i have had the       advantage of two conversations with mrs  stapleton  and the case       has now been so entirely cleared up that i am not aware that       there is anything which has remained a secret to us  you will       find a few notes upon the matter under the heading b in my       indexed list of cases           perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of       events from memory           certainly  though i cannot guarantee that i carry all the facts       in my mind  intense mental concentration has a curious way of       blotting out what has passed  the barrister who has his case at       his fingers  ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his       own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it       all out of his head once more  so each of my cases displaces the       last  and mlle  car re has blurred my recollection of baskerville       hall  tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my       notice which will in turn dispossess the fair french lady and the       infamous upwood  so far as the case of the hound goes  however  i       will give you the course of events as nearly as i can  and you       will suggest anything which i may have forgotten          my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait       did not lie  and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville  he       was a son of that rodger baskerville  the younger brother of sir       charles  who fled with a sinister reputation to south america        where he was said to have died unmarried  he did  as a matter of       fact  marry  and had one child  this fellow  whose real name is       the same as his father s  he married beryl garcia  one of the       beauties of costa rica  and  having purloined a considerable sum       of public money  he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to       england  where he established a school in the east of yorkshire        his reason for attempting this special line of business was that       he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon       the voyage home  and that he had used this man s ability to make       the undertaking a success  fraser  the tutor  died however  and       the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy        the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to       stapleton  and he brought the remains of his fortune  his schemes       for the future  and his taste for entomology to the south of       england  i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized       authority upon the subject  and that the name of vandeleur has       been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had  in his       yorkshire days  been the first to describe          we now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be       of such intense interest to us  the fellow had evidently made       inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and       a valuable estate  when he went to devonshire his plans were  i       believe  exceedingly hazy  but that he meant mischief from the       first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him       in the character of his sister  the idea of using her as a decoy       was clearly already in his mind  though he may not have been       certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged  he meant       in the end to have the estate  and he was ready to use any tool       or run any risk for that end  his first act was to establish       himself as near to his ancestral home as he could  and his second       was to cultivate a friendship with sir charles baskerville and       with the neighbours          the baronet himself told him about the family hound  and so       prepared the way for his own death  stapleton  as i will continue       to call him  knew that the old man s heart was weak and that a       shock would kill him  so much he had learned from dr  mortimer        he had heard also that sir charles was superstitious and had       taken this grim legend very seriously  his ingenious mind       instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to       death  and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the       guilt to the real murderer          having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with       considerable finesse  an ordinary schemer would have been content       to work with a savage hound  the use of artificial means to make       the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part  the       dog he bought in london from ross and mangles  the dealers in       fulham road  it was the strongest and most savage in their       possession  he brought it down by the north devon line and walked       a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without       exciting any remarks  he had already on his insect hunts learned       to penetrate the grimpen mire  and so had found a safe       hiding place for the creature  here he kennelled it and waited       his chance          but it was some time coming  the old gentleman could not be       decoyed outside of his grounds at night  several times stapleton       lurked about with his hound  but without avail  it was during       these fruitless quests that he  or rather his ally  was seen by       peasants  and that the legend of the demon dog received a new       confirmation  he had hoped that his wife might lure sir charles       to his ruin  but here she proved unexpectedly independent  she       would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a       sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy        threats and even  i am sorry to say  blows refused to move her        she would have nothing to do with it  and for a time stapleton       was at a deadlock          he found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that       sir charles  who had conceived a friendship for him  made him the       minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman        mrs  laura lyons  by representing himself as a single man he       acquired complete influence over her  and he gave her to       understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her       husband he would marry her  his plans were suddenly brought to a       head by his knowledge that sir charles was about to leave the       hall on the advice of dr  mortimer  with whose opinion he himself       pretended to coincide  he must act at once  or his victim might       get beyond his power  he therefore put pressure upon mrs  lyons       to write this letter  imploring the old man to give her an       interview on the evening before his departure for london  he       then  by a specious argument  prevented her from going  and so       had the chance for which he had waited          driving back in the evening from coombe tracey he was in time to       get his hound  to treat it with his infernal paint  and to bring       the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that       he would find the old gentleman waiting  the dog  incited by its       master  sprang over the wicket gate and pursued the unfortunate       baronet  who fled screaming down the yew alley  in that gloomy       tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge       black creature  with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes  bounding       after its victim  he fell dead at the end of the alley from heart       disease and terror  the hound had kept upon the grassy border       while the baronet had run down the path  so that no track but the       man s was visible  on seeing him lying still the creature had       probably approached to sniff at him  but finding him dead had       turned away again  it was then that it left the print which was       actually observed by dr  mortimer  the hound was called off and       hurried away to its lair in the grimpen mire  and a mystery was       left which puzzled the authorities  alarmed the countryside  and       finally brought the case within the scope of our observation          so much for the death of sir charles baskerville  you perceive       the devilish cunning of it  for really it would be almost       impossible to make a case against the real murderer  his only       accomplice was one who could never give him away  and the       grotesque  inconceivable nature of the device only served to make       it more effective  both of the women concerned in the case  mrs        stapleton and mrs  laura lyons  were left with a strong suspicion       against stapleton  mrs  stapleton knew that he had designs upon       the old man  and also of the existence of the hound  mrs  lyons       knew neither of these things  but had been impressed by the death       occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was       only known to him  however  both of them were under his       influence  and he had nothing to fear from them  the first half       of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult       still remained          it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of       an heir in canada  in any case he would very soon learn it from       his friend dr  mortimer  and he was told by the latter all       details about the arrival of henry baskerville  stapleton s first       idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be       done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all        he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in       laying a trap for the old man  and he dared not leave her long       out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her        it was for this reason that he took her to london with him  they       lodged  i find  at the mexborough private hotel  in craven       street  which was actually one of those called upon by my agent       in search of evidence  here he kept his wife imprisoned in her       room while he  disguised in a beard  followed dr  mortimer to       baker street and afterwards to the station and to the       northumberland hotel  his wife had some inkling of his plans  but       she had such a fear of her husband a fear founded upon brutal       ill treatment that she dare not write to warn the man whom she       knew to be in danger  if the letter should fall into stapleton s       hands her own life would not be safe  eventually  as we know  she       adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form       the message  and addressing the letter in a disguised hand  it       reached the baronet  and gave him the first warning of his       danger          it was very essential for stapleton to get some article of sir       henry s attire so that  in case he was driven to use the dog  he       might always have the means of setting him upon his track  with       characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once        and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber maid of the hotel       was well bribed to help him in his design  by chance  however        the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and        therefore  useless for his purpose  he then had it returned and       obtained another a most instructive incident  since it proved       conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound        as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an       old boot and this indifference to a new one  the more  outr   and       grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be       examined  and the very point which appears to complicate a case       is  when duly considered and scientifically handled  the one       which is most likely to elucidate it          then we had the visit from our friends next morning  shadowed       always by stapleton in the cab  from his knowledge of our rooms       and of my appearance  as well as from his general conduct  i am       inclined to think that stapleton s career of crime has been by no       means limited to this single baskerville affair  it is suggestive       that during the last three years there have been four       considerable burglaries in the west country  for none of which       was any criminal ever arrested  the last of these  at folkestone       court  in may  was remarkable for the cold blooded pistolling of       the page  who surprised the masked and solitary burglar  i cannot       doubt that stapleton recruited his waning resources in this       fashion  and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous       man          we had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when       he got away from us so successfully  and also of his audacity in       sending back my own name to me through the cabman  from that       moment he understood that i had taken over the case in london        and that therefore there was no chance for him there  he returned       to dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet           one moment   said i   you have  no doubt  described the sequence       of events correctly  but there is one point which you have left       unexplained  what became of the hound when its master was in       london           i have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly       of importance  there can be no question that stapleton had a       confidant  though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in       his power by sharing all his plans with him  there was an old       manservant at merripit house  whose name was anthony  his       connection with the stapletons can be traced for several years        as far back as the school mastering days  so that he must have       been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and       wife  this man has disappeared and has escaped from the country        it is suggestive that anthony is not a common name in england        while antonio is so in all spanish or spanish american countries        the man  like mrs  stapleton herself  spoke good english  but       with a curious lisping accent  i have myself seen this old man       cross the grimpen mire by the path which stapleton had marked       out  it is very probable  therefore  that in the absence of his       master it was he who cared for the hound  though he may never       have known the purpose for which the beast was used          the stapletons then went down to devonshire  whither they were       soon followed by sir henry and you  one word now as to how i       stood myself at that time  it may possibly recur to your memory       that when i examined the paper upon which the printed words were       fastened i made a close inspection for the water mark  in doing       so i held it within a few inches of my eyes  and was conscious of       a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine  there are       seventy five perfumes  which it is very necessary that a criminal       expert should be able to distinguish from each other  and cases       have more than once within my own experience depended upon their       prompt recognition  the scent suggested the presence of a lady        and already my thoughts began to turn towards the stapletons        thus i had made certain of the hound  and had guessed at the       criminal before ever we went to the west country          it was my game to watch stapleton  it was evident  however  that       i could not do this if i were with you  since he would be keenly       on his guard  i deceived everybody  therefore  yourself included        and i came down secretly when i was supposed to be in london  my       hardships were not so great as you imagined  though such trifling       details must never interfere with the investigation of a case  i       stayed for the most part at coombe tracey  and only used the hut       upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of       action  cartwright had come down with me  and in his disguise as       a country boy he was of great assistance to me  i was dependent       upon him for food and clean linen  when i was watching stapleton        cartwright was frequently watching you  so that i was able to       keep my hand upon all the strings          i have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly        being forwarded instantly from baker street to coombe tracey        they were of great service to me  and especially that one       incidentally truthful piece of biography of stapleton s  i was       able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew       at last exactly how i stood  the case had been considerably       complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the       relations between him and the barrymores  this also you cleared       up in a very effective way  though i had already come to the same       conclusions from my own observations          by the time that you discovered me upon the moor i had a       complete knowledge of the whole business  but i had not a case       which could go to a jury  even stapleton s attempt upon sir henry       that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict       did not help us much in proving murder against our man  there       seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red handed  and to       do so we had to use sir henry  alone and apparently unprotected        as a bait  we did so  and at the cost of a severe shock to our       client we succeeded in completing our case and driving stapleton       to his destruction  that sir henry should have been exposed to       this is  i must confess  a reproach to my management of the case        but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing       spectacle which the beast presented  nor could we predict the fog       which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice  we       succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and       dr  mortimer assure me will be a temporary one  a long journey       may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered       nerves but also from his wounded feelings  his love for the lady       was deep and sincere  and to him the saddest part of all this       black business was that he should have been deceived by her          it only remains to indicate the part which she had played       throughout  there can be no doubt that stapleton exercised an       influence over her which may have been love or may have been       fear  or very possibly both  since they are by no means       incompatible emotions  it was  at least  absolutely effective  at       his command she consented to pass as his sister  though he found       the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her       the direct accessory to murder  she was ready to warn sir henry       so far as she could without implicating her husband  and again       and again she tried to do so  stapleton himself seems to have       been capable of jealousy  and when he saw the baronet paying       court to the lady  even though it was part of his own plan  still       he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which       revealed the fiery soul which his self contained manner so       cleverly concealed  by encouraging the intimacy he made it       certain that sir henry would frequently come to merripit house       and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he       desired  on the day of the crisis  however  his wife turned       suddenly against him  she had learned something of the death of       the convict  and she knew that the hound was being kept in the       outhouse on the evening that sir henry was coming to dinner  she       taxed her husband with his intended crime  and a furious scene       followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a       rival in his love  her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter       hatred  and he saw that she would betray him  he tied her up        therefore  that she might have no chance of warning sir henry        and he hoped  no doubt  that when the whole countryside put down       the baronet s death to the curse of his family  as they certainly       would do  he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished       fact and to keep silent upon what she knew  in this i fancy that       in any case he made a miscalculation  and that  if we had not       been there  his doom would none the less have been sealed  a       woman of spanish blood does not condone such an injury so       lightly  and now  my dear watson  without referring to my notes        i cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case  i       do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained           he could not hope to frighten sir henry to death as he had done       the old uncle with his bogie hound           the beast was savage and half starved  if its appearance did not       frighten its victim to death  at least it would paralyze the       resistance which might be offered           no doubt  there only remains one difficulty  if stapleton came       into the succession  how could he explain the fact that he  the       heir  had been living unannounced under another name so close to       the property  how could he claim it without causing suspicion and       inquiry           it is a formidable difficulty  and i fear that you ask too much       when you expect me to solve it  the past and the present are       within the field of my inquiry  but what a man may do in the       future is a hard question to answer  mrs  stapleton has heard her       husband discuss the problem on several occasions  there were       three possible courses  he might claim the property from south       america  establish his identity before the british authorities       there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to england at       all  or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short       time that he need be in london  or  again  he might furnish an       accomplice with the proofs and papers  putting him in as heir        and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income  we       cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found       some way out of the difficulty  and now  my dear watson  we have       had some weeks of severe work  and for one evening  i think  we       may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels  i have a box       for  les huguenots   have you heard the de reszkes  might i       trouble you then to be ready in half an hour  and we can stop at       marcini s for a little dinner on the way     the end  \")"

breakfast table  i stood upon the      hearth rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left      behind him the night before  it was a fine  thick piece of wood       bulbous headed  of the sort which is known as a  penang lawyer        just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch      across   to james mortimer  m r c s   from his friends of the      c c h    was engraved upon it  with the date         it was just      such a stick as the old fashioned family practitioner used to      carry dignified  solid  and reassuring        well  watson  what do you make of it        holmes was sitting with his back to me  and i had given him no      sign of my occupation        how did you know what i was doing  i believe you have eyes in      the back of your head         i have  at least  a well polished  silver plated coffee pot in      front of me   said he   but  tell me  watson  what do you make of      our visitor s stick  since we have been so unfortunate as to miss      him and have no notion of his errand  this accidental souvenir      becomes of importance  let me hear you reconstruct the man by an      examination of it         i think   said i  following as far as i could the methods of my      companion   that dr  mortimer is a successful  elderly medical      man  well esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of      their appreciation         good   said holmes   excellent         i think also that the probability is in favour of his being a      country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on      foot         why so         because this stick  though originally a very handsome one has      been so knocked about that i can hardly imagine a town      practitioner carrying it  the thick iron ferrule is worn down  so      it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with      it         perfectly sound   said holmes        and then again  there is the  friends of the c c h   i should      guess that to be the something hunt  the local hunt to whose      members he has possibly given some surgical assistance  and which      has made him a small presentation in return         really  watson  you excel yourself   said holmes  pushing back      his chair and lighting a cigarette   i am bound to say that in      all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own      small achievements you have habitually underrated your own      abilities  it may be that you are not yourself luminous  but you      are a conductor of light  some people without possessing genius      have a remarkable power of stimulating it  i confess  my dear      fellow  that i am very much in your debt        he had never said as much before  and i must admit that his words      gave me keen pleasure  for i had often been piqued by his      indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which i had      made to give publicity to his methods  i was proud  too  to think      that i had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way      which earned his approval  he now took the stick from my hands      and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes  then with      an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette  and      carrying the cane to the window  he looked over it again with a      convex lens        interesting  though elementary   said he as he returned to his      favourite corner of the settee   there are certainly one or two      indications upon the stick  it gives us the basis for several      deductions         has anything escaped me   i asked with some self importance   i      trust that there is nothing of consequence which i have      overlooked         i am afraid  my dear watson  that most of your conclusions were      erroneous  when i said that you stimulated me i meant  to be      frank  that in noting your fallacies i was occasionally guided      towards the truth  not that you are entirely wrong in this      instance  the man is certainly a country practitioner  and he      walks a good deal         then i was right         to that extent         but that was all         no  no  my dear watson  not all by no means all  i would      suggest  for example  that a presentation to a doctor is more      likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt  and that when      the initials  c c   are placed before that hospital the words       charing cross  very naturally suggest themselves         you may be right         the probability lies in that direction  and if we take this as a      working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our      construction of this unknown visitor         well  then  supposing that  c c h   does stand for  charing      cross hospital   what further inferences may we draw         do none suggest themselves  you know my methods  apply them         i can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has      practised in town before going to the country         i think that we might venture a little farther than this  look      at it in this light  on what occasion would it be most probable      that such a presentation would be made  when would his friends      unite to give him a pledge of their good will  obviously at the      moment when dr  mortimer withdrew from the service of the      hospital in order to start a practice for himself  we know there      has been a presentation  we believe there has been a change from      a town hospital to a country practice  is it  then  stretching      our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the      occasion of the change         it certainly seems probable         now  you will observe that he could not have been on the  staff       of the hospital  since only a man well established in a london      practice could hold such a position  and such a one would not      drift into the country  what was he  then  if he was in the      hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a      house surgeon or a house physician little more than a senior      student  and he left five years ago the date is on the stick  so      your grave  middle aged family practitioner vanishes into thin      air  my dear watson  and there emerges a young fellow under      thirty  amiable  unambitious  absent minded  and the possessor of      a favourite dog  which i should describe roughly as being larger      than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff        i laughed incredulously as sherlock holmes leaned back in his      settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling        as to the latter part  i have no means of checking you   said i        but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars      about the man s age and professional career   from my small      medical shelf i took down the medical directory and turned up the      name  there were several mortimers  but only one who could be our      visitor  i read his record aloud          mortimer  james  m r c s         grimpen  dartmoor  devon         house surgeon  from      to       at charing cross hospital         winner of the jackson prize for comparative pathology  with        essay entitled  is disease a reversion    corresponding member        of the swedish pathological society   author of  some freaks of        atavism    lancet           do we progress     journal of        psychology   march         medical officer for the parishes of        grimpen  thorsley  and high barrow         no mention of that local hunt  watson   said holmes with a      mischievous smile   but a country doctor  as you very astutely      observed  i think that i am fairly justified in my inferences  as      to the adjectives  i said  if i remember right  amiable       unambitious  and absent minded  it is my experience that it is      only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials  only      an unambitious one who abandons a london career for the country       and only an absent minded one who leaves his stick and not his      visiting card after waiting an hour in your room         and the dog         has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master       being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle       and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible  the dog s      jaw  as shown in the space between these marks  is too broad in      my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff  it      may have been yes  by jove  it  is  a curly haired spaniel        he had risen and paced the room as he spoke  now he halted in the      recess of the window  there was such a ring of conviction in his      voice that i glanced up in surprise        my dear fellow  how can you possibly be so sure of that         for the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our      very door step  and there is the ring of its owner  don t move  i      beg you  watson  he is a professional brother of yours  and your      presence may be of assistance to me  now is the dramatic moment      of fate  watson  when you hear a step upon the stair which is      walking into your life  and you know not whether for good or ill       what does dr  james mortimer  the man of science  ask of sherlock      holmes  the specialist in crime  come in        the appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me  since i had      expected a typical country practitioner  he was a very tall  thin      man  with a long nose like a beak  which jutted out between two      keen  grey eyes  set closely together and sparkling brightly from      behind a pair of gold rimmed glasses  he was clad in a      professional but rather slovenly fashion  for his frock coat was      dingy and his trousers frayed  though young  his long back was      already bowed  and he walked with a forward thrust of his head      and a general air of peering benevolence  as he entered his eyes      fell upon the stick in holmes s hand  and he ran towards it with      an exclamation of joy   i am so very glad   said he   i was not      sure whether i had left it here or in the shipping office  i      would not lose that stick for the world         a presentation  i see   said holmes        yes  sir         from charing cross hospital         from one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage         dear  dear  that s bad   said holmes  shaking his head       dr  mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment        why was it bad         only that you have disarranged our little deductions  your      marriage  you say         yes  sir  i married  and so left the hospital  and with it all      hopes of a consulting practice  it was necessary to make a home      of my own         come  come  we are not so far wrong  after all   said holmes        and now  dr  james mortimer         mister  sir  mister a humble m r c s         and a man of precise mind  evidently         a dabbler in science  mr  holmes  a picker up of shells on the      shores of the great unknown ocean  i presume that it is mr       sherlock holmes whom i am addressing and not         no  this is my friend dr  watson         glad to meet you  sir  i have heard your name mentioned in      connection with that of your friend  you interest me very much       mr  holmes  i had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or      such well marked supra orbital development  would you have any      objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure  a      cast of your skull  sir  until the original is available  would      be an ornament to any anthropological museum  it is not my      intention to be fulsome  but i confess that i covet your skull        sherlock holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair   you are      an enthusiast in your line of thought  i perceive  sir  as i am      in mine   said he   i observe from your forefinger that you make      your own cigarettes  have no hesitation in lighting one        the man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the      other with surprising dexterity  he had long  quivering fingers      as agile and restless as the antenn  of an insect       holmes was silent  but his little darting glances showed me the      interest which he took in our curious companion   i presume       sir   said he at last   that it was not merely for the purpose of      examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here      last night and again today         no  sir  no  though i am happy to have had the opportunity of      doing that as well  i came to you  mr  holmes  because i      recognized that i am myself an unpractical man and because i am      suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary      problem  recognizing  as i do  that you are the second highest      expert in europe         indeed  sir  may i inquire who has the honour to be the first        asked holmes with some asperity        to the man of precisely scientific mind the work of monsieur      bertillon must always appeal strongly         then had you not better consult him         i said  sir  to the precisely scientific mind  but as a      practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone       i trust  sir  that i have not inadvertently         just a little   said holmes   i think  dr  mortimer  you would      do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly      what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my      assistance  ',\n",
       " 'the curse of the baskervilles       i have in my pocket a manuscript   said dr  james mortimer        i observed it as you entered the room   said holmes        it is an old manuscript         early eighteenth century  unless it is a forgery         how can you say that  sir         you have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all      the time that you have been talking  it would be a poor expert      who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so       you may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject       i put that at              the exact date is        dr  mortimer drew it from his      breast pocket   this family paper was committed to my care by sir      charles baskerville  whose sudden and tragic death some three      months ago created so much excitement in devonshire  i may say      that i was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant       he was a strong minded man  sir  shrewd  practical  and as      unimaginative as i am myself  yet he took this document very      seriously  and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did      eventually overtake him        holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it      upon his knee   you will observe  watson  the alternative use of      the long  s  and the short  it is one of several indications      which enabled me to fix the date        i looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded      script  at the head was written   baskerville hall   and below in      large  scrawling figures                it appears to be a statement of some sort         yes  it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the      baskerville family         but i understand that it is something more modern and practical      upon which you wish to consult me         most modern  a most practical  pressing matter  which must be      decided within twenty four hours  but the manuscript is short and      is intimately connected with the affair  with your permission i      will read it to you        holmes leaned back in his chair  placed his finger tips together       and closed his eyes  with an air of resignation  dr  mortimer      turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high  cracking      voice the following curious  old world narrative          of the origin of the hound of the baskervilles there have been        many statements  yet as i come in a direct line from hugo        baskerville  and as i had the story from my father  who also        had it from his  i have set it down with all belief that it        occurred even as is here set forth  and i would have you        believe  my sons  that the same justice which punishes sin may        also most graciously forgive it  and that no ban is so heavy        but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed   learn        then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past  but        rather to be circumspect in the future  that those foul        passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not        again be loosed to our undoing              know then that in the time of the great rebellion  the            history of which by the learned lord clarendon i most            earnestly commend to your attention  this manor of            baskerville was held by hugo of that name  nor can it be            gainsaid that he was a most wild  profane  and godless man              this  in truth  his neighbours might have pardoned  seeing            that saints have never flourished in those parts  but there            was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his            name a by word through the west   it chanced that this hugo            came to love  if  indeed  so dark a passion may be known            under so bright a name  the daughter of a yeoman who held            lands near the baskerville estate  but the young maiden             being discreet and of good repute  would ever avoid him             for she feared his evil name   so it came to pass that one            michaelmas this hugo  with five or six of his idle and            wicked companions  stole down upon the farm and carried off            the maiden  her father and brothers being from home  as he            well knew   when they had brought her to the hall the            maiden was placed in an upper chamber  while hugo and his            friends sat down to a long carouse  as was their nightly            custom   now  the poor lass upstairs was like to have her            wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths            which came up to her from below  for they say that the            words used by hugo baskerville  when he was in wine  were            such as might blast the man who said them   at last in the            stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted            the bravest or most active man  for by the aid of the            growth of ivy which covered  and still covers  the south            wall she came down from under the eaves  and so homeward            across the moor  there being three leagues betwixt the hall            and her father s farm              it chanced that some little time later hugo left his            guests to carry food and drink with other worse things             perchance to his captive  and so found the cage empty and            the bird escaped   then  as it would seem  he became as one            that hath a devil  for  rushing down the stairs into the            dining hall  he sprang upon the great table  flagons and            trenchers flying before him  and he cried aloud before all            the company that he would that very night render his body            and soul to the powers of evil if he might but overtake the            wench   and while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of            the man  one more wicked or  it may be  more drunken than            the rest  cried out that they should put the hounds upon            her   whereat hugo ran from the house  crying to his grooms            that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack  and            giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid s  he swung them            to the line  and so off full cry in the moonlight over the            moor              now  for some space the revellers stood agape  unable to            understand all that had been done in such haste   but anon            their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which            was like to be done upon the moorlands   everything was now            in an uproar  some calling for their pistols  some for            their horses  and some for another flask of wine   but at            length some sense came back to their crazed minds  and the            whole of them  thirteen in number  took horse and started            in pursuit   the moon shone clear above them  and they rode            swiftly abreast  taking that course which the maid must            needs have taken if she were to reach her own home              they had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the            night shepherds upon the moorlands  and they cried to him            to know if he had seen the hunt   and the man  as the story            goes  was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak             but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy            maiden  with the hounds upon her track    but i have seen            more than that   said he   for hugo baskerville passed me            upon his black mare  and there ran mute behind him such a            hound of hell as god forbid should ever be at my heels               so the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward              but soon their skins turned cold  for there came a            galloping across the moor  and the black mare  dabbled with            white froth  went past with trailing bridle and empty            saddle   then the revellers rode close together  for a            great fear was on them  but they still followed over the            moor  though each  had he been alone  would have been right            glad to have turned his horse s head   riding slowly in            this fashion they came at last upon the hounds   these             though known for their valour and their breed  were            whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal             as we call it  upon the moor  some slinking away and some             with starting hackles and staring eyes  gazing down the            narrow valley before them              the company had come to a halt  more sober men  as you may            guess  than when they started   the most of them would by            no means advance  but three of them  the boldest  or it may            be the most drunken  rode forward down the goyal  now  it            opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great            stones  still to be seen there  which were set by certain            forgotten peoples in the days of old  the moon was shining            bright upon the clearing  and there in the centre lay the            unhappy maid where she had fallen  dead of fear and of            fatigue   but it was not the sight of her body  nor yet was            it that of the body of hugo baskerville lying near her             which raised the hair upon the heads of these three            dare devil roysterers  but it was that  standing over hugo             and plucking at his throat  there stood a foul thing  a            great  black beast  shaped like a hound  yet larger than            any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon   and even            as they looked the thing tore the throat out of hugo            baskerville  on which  as it turned its blazing eyes and            dripping jaws upon them  the three shrieked with fear and            rode for dear life  still screaming  across the moor   one             it is said  died that very night of what he had seen  and            the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their            days              such is the tale  my sons  of the coming of the hound            which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever            since   if i have set it down it is because that which is            clearly known hath less terror than that which is but            hinted at and guessed   nor can it be denied that many of            the family have been unhappy in their deaths  which have            been sudden  bloody  and mysterious   yet may we shelter            ourselves in the infinite goodness of providence  which            would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or            fourth generation which is threatened in holy writ   to            that providence  my sons  i hereby commend you  and i            counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the            moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are            exalted               this from hugo baskerville to his sons rodger and john             with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their            sister elizabeth         when dr  mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he      pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at mr       sherlock holmes  the latter yawned and tossed the end of his      cigarette into the fire        well   said he        do you not find it interesting         to a collector of fairy tales        dr  mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket        now  mr  holmes  we will give you something a little more      recent  this is the  devon county chronicle  of may   th of this      year  it is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of      sir charles baskerville which occurred a few days before that      date        my friend leaned a little forward and his expression became      intent  our visitor readjusted his glasses and began          the recent sudden death of sir charles baskerville  whose name        has been mentioned as the probable liberal candidate for        mid devon at the next election  has cast a gloom over the        county   though sir charles had resided at baskerville hall for        a comparatively short period his amiability of character and        extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who        had been brought into contact with him   in these days of         nouveaux riches  it is refreshing to find a case where the        scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days        is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him        to restore the fallen grandeur of his line   sir charles  as is        well known  made large sums of money in south african        speculation  more wise than those who go on until the wheel        turns against them  he realised his gains and returned to        england with them   it is only two years since he took up his        residence at baskerville hall  and it is common talk how large        were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have        been interrupted by his death   being himself childless  it was        his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should         within his own lifetime  profit by his good fortune  and many        will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end   his        generous donations to local and county charities have been        frequently chronicled in these columns              the circumstances connected with the death of sir charles            cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the            inquest  but at least enough has been done to dispose of            those rumours to which local superstition has given rise             there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play  or to            imagine that death could be from any but natural causes             sir charles was a widower  and a man who may be said to            have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind  in            spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his            personal tastes  and his indoor servants at baskerville            hall consisted of a married couple named barrymore  the            husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper  their            evidence  corroborated by that of several friends  tends to            show that sir charles s health has for some time been            impaired  and points especially to some affection of the            heart  manifesting itself in changes of colour             breathlessness  and acute attacks of nervous depression             dr  james mortimer  the friend and medical attendant of the            deceased  has given evidence to the same effect              the facts of the case are simple   sir charles baskerville            was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking            down the famous yew alley of baskerville hall   the            evidence of the barrymores shows that this had been his            custom  on the fourth of may sir charles had declared his            intention of starting next day for london  and had ordered            barrymore to prepare his luggage   that night he went out            as usual for his nocturnal walk  in the course of which he            was in the habit of smoking a cigar   he never returned              at twelve o clock barrymore  finding the hall door still            open  became alarmed  and  lighting a lantern  went in            search of his master   the day had been wet  and sir            charles s footmarks were easily traced down the alley              halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on            to the moor  there were indications that sir charles had            stood for some little time here   he then proceeded down            the alley  and it was at the far end of it that his body            was discovered  one fact which has not been explained is            the statement of barrymore that his master s footprints            altered their character from the time that he passed the            moor gate  and that he appeared from thence onward to have            been walking upon his toes   one murphy  a gipsy            horse dealer  was on the moor at no great distance at the            time  but he appears by his own confession to have been the            worse for drink  he declares that he heard cries but is            unable to state from what direction they came   no signs of            violence were to be discovered upon sir charles s person             and though the doctor s evidence pointed to an almost            incredible facial distortion so great that dr  mortimer            refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend            and patient who lay before him it was explained that that            is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspn a and            death from cardiac exhaustion   this explanation was borne            out by the post mortem examination  which showed            long standing organic disease  and the coroner s jury            returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence              it is well that this is so  for it is obviously of the            utmost importance that sir charles s heir should settle at            the hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly            interrupted   had the prosaic finding of the coroner not            finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been            whispered in connection with the affair  it might have been            difficult to find a tenant for baskerville hall   it is            understood that the next of kin is mr  henry baskerville             if he be still alive  the son of sir charles baskerville s            younger brother   the young man when last heard of was in            america  and inquiries are being instituted with a view to            informing him of his good fortune        dr  mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket        those are the public facts  mr  holmes  in connection with the      death of sir charles baskerville         i must thank you   said sherlock holmes   for calling my      attention to a case which certainly presents some features of      interest  i had observed some newspaper comment at the time  but      i was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the      vatican cameos  and in my anxiety to oblige the pope i lost touch      with several interesting english cases  this article  you say       contains all the public facts         it does         then let me have the private ones   he leaned back  put his      finger tips together  and assumed his most impassive and judicial      expression        in doing so   said dr  mortimer  who had begun to show signs of      some strong emotion   i am telling that which i have not confided      to anyone  my motive for withholding it from the coroner s      inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in      the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition       i had the further motive that baskerville hall  as the paper      says  would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to      increase its already rather grim reputation  for both these      reasons i thought that i was justified in telling rather less      than i knew  since no practical good could result from it  but      with you there is no reason why i should not be perfectly frank        the moor is very sparsely inhabited  and those who live near      each other are thrown very much together  for this reason i saw a      good deal of sir charles baskerville  with the exception of mr       frankland  of lafter hall  and mr  stapleton  the naturalist       there are no other men of education within many miles  sir      charles was a retiring man  but the chance of his illness brought      us together  and a community of interests in science kept us so       he had brought back much scientific information from south      africa  and many a charming evening we have spent together      discussing the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the      hottentot        within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me      that sir charles s nervous system was strained to the breaking      point  he had taken this legend which i have read you exceedingly      to heart so much so that  although he would walk in his own      grounds  nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at      night  incredible as it may appear to you  mr  holmes  he was      honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family  and      certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors      were not encouraging  the idea of some ghastly presence      constantly haunted him  and on more than one occasion he has      asked me whether i had on my medical journeys at night ever seen      any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound  the latter      question he put to me several times  and always with a voice      which vibrated with excitement        i can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some      three weeks before the fatal event  he chanced to be at his hall      door  i had descended from my gig and was standing in front of      him  when i saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and      stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror  i      whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something      which i took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the      drive  so excited and alarmed was he that i was compelled to go      down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for      it  it was gone  however  and the incident appeared to make the      worst impression upon his mind  i stayed with him all the      evening  and it was on that occasion  to explain the emotion      which he had shown  that he confided to my keeping that narrative      which i read to you when first i came  i mention this small      episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy      which followed  but i was convinced at the time that the matter      was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no      justification        it was at my advice that sir charles was about to go to london       his heart was  i knew  affected  and the constant anxiety in      which he lived  however chimerical the cause of it might be  was      evidently having a serious effect upon his health  i thought that      a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a      new man  mr  stapleton  a mutual friend who was much concerned at      his state of health  was of the same opinion  at the last instant      came this terrible catastrophe        on the night of sir charles s death barrymore the butler  who      made the discovery  sent perkins the groom on horseback to me       and as i was sitting up late i was able to reach baskerville hall      within an hour of the event  i checked and corroborated all the      facts which were mentioned at the inquest  i followed the      footsteps down the yew alley  i saw the spot at the moor gate      where he seemed to have waited  i remarked the change in the      shape of the prints after that point  i noted that there were no      other footsteps save those of barrymore on the soft gravel  and      finally i carefully examined the body  which had not been touched      until my arrival  sir charles lay on his face  his arms out  his      fingers dug into the ground  and his features convulsed with some      strong emotion to such an extent that i could hardly have sworn      to his identity  there was certainly no physical injury of any      kind  but one false statement was made by barrymore at the      inquest  he said that there were no traces upon the ground round      the body  he did not observe any  but i did some little distance      off  but fresh and clear         footprints         footprints         a man s or a woman s        dr  mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant  and his voice      sank almost to a whisper as he answered        mr  holmes  they were the footprints of a gigantic hound  ',\n",
       " 'the problem      i confess at these words a shudder passed through me  there was a      thrill in the doctor s voice which showed that he was himself      deeply moved by that which he told us  holmes leaned forward in      his excitement and his eyes had the hard  dry glitter which shot      from them when he was keenly interested        you saw this         as clearly as i see you         and you said nothing         what was the use         how was it that no one else saw it         the marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave      them a thought  i don t suppose i should have done so had i not      known this legend         there are many sheep dogs on the moor         no doubt  but this was no sheep dog         you say it was large         enormous         but it had not approached the body         no         what sort of night was it         damp and raw         but not actually raining         no         what is the alley like         there are two lines of old yew hedge  twelve feet high and      impenetrable  the walk in the centre is about eight feet across         is there anything between the hedges and the walk         yes  there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either      side         i understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a      gate         yes  the wicket gate which leads on to the moor         is there any other opening         none         so that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it      from the house or else to enter it by the moor gate         there is an exit through a summer house at the far end         had sir charles reached this         no  he lay about fifty yards from it         now  tell me  dr  mortimer and this is important the marks which      you saw were on the path and not on the grass         no marks could show on the grass         were they on the same side of the path as the moor gate         yes  they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the      moor gate         you interest me exceedingly  another point  was the wicket gate      closed         closed and padlocked         how high was it         about four feet high         then anyone could have got over it         yes         and what marks did you see by the wicket gate         none in particular         good heaven  did no one examine         yes  i examined  myself         and found nothing         it was all very confused  sir charles had evidently stood there      for five or ten minutes         how do you know that         because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar         excellent  this is a colleague  watson  after our own heart  but      the marks         he had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel  i      could discern no others        sherlock holmes struck his hand against his knee with an      impatient gesture        if i had only been there   he cried   it is evidently a case of      extraordinary interest  and one which presented immense      opportunities to the scientific expert  that gravel page upon      which i might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by      the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants  oh  dr       mortimer  dr  mortimer  to think that you should not have called      me in  you have indeed much to answer for         i could not call you in  mr  holmes  without disclosing these      facts to the world  and i have already given my reasons for not      wishing to do so  besides  besides         why do you hesitate         there is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of      detectives is helpless         you mean that the thing is supernatural         i did not positively say so         no  but you evidently think it         since the tragedy  mr  holmes  there have come to my ears      several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled      order of nature         for example         i find that before the terrible event occurred several people      had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this      baskerville demon  and which could not possibly be any animal      known to science  they all agreed that it was a huge creature       luminous  ghastly  and spectral  i have cross examined these men       one of them a hard headed countryman  one a farrier  and one a      moorland farmer  who all tell the same story of this dreadful      apparition  exactly corresponding to the hell hound of the      legend  i assure you that there is a reign of terror in the      district  and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at      night         and you  a trained man of science  believe it to be      supernatural         i do not know what to believe        holmes shrugged his shoulders   i have hitherto confined my      investigations to this world   said he   in a modest way i have      combated evil  but to take on the father of evil himself would       perhaps  be too ambitious a task  yet you must admit that the      footmark is material         the original hound was material enough to tug a man s throat      out  and yet he was diabolical as well         i see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists  but      now  dr  mortimer  tell me this  if you hold these views  why      have you come to consult me at all  you tell me in the same      breath that it is useless to investigate sir charles s death  and      that you desire me to do it         i did not say that i desired you to do it         then  how can i assist you         by advising me as to what i should do with sir henry      baskerville  who arrives at waterloo station  dr  mortimer looked      at his watch  in exactly one hour and a quarter         he being the heir         yes  on the death of sir charles we inquired for this young      gentleman and found that he had been farming in canada  from the      accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every      way  i speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and      executor of sir charles s will         there is no other claimant  i presume         none  the only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was      rodger baskerville  the youngest of three brothers of whom poor      sir charles was the elder  the second brother  who died young  is      the father of this lad henry  the third  rodger  was the black      sheep of the family  he came of the old masterful baskerville      strain and was the very image  they tell me  of the family      picture of old hugo  he made england too hot to hold him  fled to      central america  and died there in      of yellow fever  henry is      the last of the baskervilles  in one hour and five minutes i meet      him at waterloo station  i have had a wire that he arrived at      southampton this morning  now  mr  holmes  what would you advise      me to do with him         why should he not go to the home of his fathers         it seems natural  does it not  and yet  consider that every      baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate  i feel sure      that if sir charles could have spoken with me before his death he      would have warned me against bringing this  the last of the old      race  and the heir to great wealth  to that deadly place  and yet      it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor  bleak      countryside depends upon his presence  all the good work which      has been done by sir charles will crash to the ground if there is      no tenant of the hall  i fear lest i should be swayed too much by      my own obvious interest in the matter  and that is why i bring      the case before you and ask for your advice        holmes considered for a little time        put into plain words  the matter is this   said he   in your      opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes dartmoor an      unsafe abode for a baskerville that is your opinion         at least i might go the length of saying that there is some      evidence that this may be so         exactly  but surely  if your supernatural theory be correct  it      could work the young man evil in london as easily as in      devonshire  a devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry      would be too inconceivable a thing         you put the matter more flippantly  mr  holmes  than you would      probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these      things  your advice  then  as i understand it  is that the young      man will be as safe in devonshire as in london  he comes in fifty      minutes  what would you recommend         i recommend  sir  that you take a cab  call off your spaniel who      is scratching at my front door  and proceed to waterloo to meet      sir henry baskerville         and then         and then you will say nothing to him at all until i have made up      my mind about the matter         how long will it take you to make up your mind         twenty four hours  at ten o clock tomorrow  dr  mortimer  i will      be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here  and it will      be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring sir      henry baskerville with you         i will do so  mr  holmes   he scribbled the appointment on his      shirt cuff and hurried off in his strange  peering  absent minded      fashion  holmes stopped him at the head of the stair        only one more question  dr  mortimer  you say that before sir      charles baskerville s death several people saw this apparition      upon the moor         three people did         did any see it after         i have not heard of any         thank you  good morning        holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward      satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him        going out  watson         unless i can help you         no  my dear fellow  it is at the hour of action that i turn to      you for aid  but this is splendid  really unique from some points      of view  when you pass bradley s  would you ask him to send up a      pound of the strongest shag tobacco  thank you  it would be as      well if you could make it convenient not to return before      evening  then i should be very glad to compare impressions as to      this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this      morning        i knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my      friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during      which he weighed every particle of evidence  constructed      alternative theories  balanced one against the other  and made up      his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial       i therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to baker      street until evening  it was nearly nine o clock when i found      myself in the sitting room once more       my first impression as i opened the door was that a fire had      broken out  for the room was so filled with smoke that the light      of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it  as i entered       however  my fears were set at rest  for it was the acrid fumes of      strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me      coughing  through the haze i had a vague vision of holmes in his      dressing gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe      between his lips  several rolls of paper lay around him        caught cold  watson   said he        no  it s this poisonous atmosphere         i suppose it  is  pretty thick  now that you mention it         thick  it is intolerable         open the window  then  you have been at your club all day  i      perceive         my dear holmes         am i right         certainly  but how        he laughed at my bewildered expression   there is a delightful      freshness about you  watson  which makes it a pleasure to      exercise any small powers which i possess at your expense  a      gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day  he returns      immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his      boots  he has been a fixture therefore all day  he is not a man      with intimate friends  where  then  could he have been  is it not      obvious         well  it is rather obvious         the world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance      ever observes  where do you think that i have been         a fixture also         on the contrary  i have been to devonshire         in spirit         exactly  my body has remained in this armchair and has  i regret      to observe  consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and      an incredible amount of tobacco  after you left i sent down to      stamford s for the ordnance map of this portion of the moor  and      my spirit has hovered over it all day  i flatter myself that i      could find my way about         a large scale map  i presume         very large        he unrolled one section and held it over his knee   here you have      the particular district which concerns us  that is baskerville      hall in the middle         with a wood round it         exactly  i fancy the yew alley  though not marked under that      name  must stretch along this line  with the moor  as you      perceive  upon the right of it  this small clump of buildings      here is the hamlet of grimpen  where our friend dr  mortimer has      his headquarters  within a radius of five miles there are  as you      see  only a very few scattered dwellings  here is lafter hall       which was mentioned in the narrative  there is a house indicated      here which may be the residence of the naturalist stapleton  if i      remember right  was his name  here are two moorland farmhouses       high tor and foulmire  then fourteen miles away the great convict      prison of princetown  between and around these scattered points      extends the desolate  lifeless moor  this  then  is the stage      upon which tragedy has been played  and upon which we may help to      play it again         it must be a wild place         yes  the setting is a worthy one  if the devil did desire to      have a hand in the affairs of men         then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural      explanation         the devil s agents may be of flesh and blood  may they not       there are two questions waiting for us at the outset  the one is      whether any crime has been committed at all  the second is  what      is the crime and how was it committed  of course  if dr       mortimer s surmise should be correct  and we are dealing with      forces outside the ordinary laws of nature  there is an end of      our investigation  but we are bound to exhaust all other      hypotheses before falling back upon this one  i think we ll shut      that window again  if you don t mind  it is a singular thing  but      i find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of      thought  i have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box      to think  but that is the logical outcome of my convictions  have      you turned the case over in your mind         yes  i have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day         what do you make of it         it is very bewildering         it has certainly a character of its own  there are points of      distinction about it  that change in the footprints  for example       what do you make of that         mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that      portion of the alley         he only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest  why      should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley         what then         he was running  watson running desperately  running for his      life  running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his      face         running from what         there lies our problem  there are indications that the man was      crazed with fear before ever he began to run         how can you say that         i am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across      the moor  if that were so  and it seems most probable  only a man      who had lost his wits would have run  from  the house instead of      towards it  if the gipsy s evidence may be taken as true  he ran      with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely      to be  then  again  whom was he waiting for that night  and why      was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own      house         you think that he was waiting for someone         the man was elderly and infirm  we can understand his taking an      evening stroll  but the ground was damp and the night inclement       is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes  as      dr  mortimer  with more practical sense than i should have given      him credit for  deduced from the cigar ash         but he went out every evening         i think it unlikely that he waited at the moor gate every      evening  on the contrary  the evidence is that he avoided the      moor  that night he waited there  it was the night before he made      his departure for london  the thing takes shape  watson  it      becomes coherent  might i ask you to hand me my violin  and we      will postpone all further thought upon this business until we      have had the advantage of meeting dr  mortimer and sir henry      baskerville in the morning  ',\n",
       " 'sir henry baskerville      our breakfast table was cleared early  and holmes waited in his      dressing gown for the promised interview  our clients were      punctual to their appointment  for the clock had just struck ten      when dr  mortimer was shown up  followed by the young baronet       the latter was a small  alert  dark eyed man about thirty years      of age  very sturdily built  with thick black eyebrows and a      strong  pugnacious face  he wore a ruddy tinted tweed suit and      had the weather beaten appearance of one who has spent most of      his time in the open air  and yet there was something in his      steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated      the gentleman        this is sir henry baskerville   said dr  mortimer        why  yes   said he   and the strange thing is  mr  sherlock      holmes  that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to      you this morning i should have come on my own account  i      understand that you think out little puzzles  and i ve had one      this morning which wants more thinking out than i am able to give      it         pray take a seat  sir henry  do i understand you to say that you      have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in      london         nothing of much importance  mr  holmes  only a joke  as like as      not  it was this letter  if you can call it a letter  which      reached me this morning        he laid an envelope upon the table  and we all bent over it  it      was of common quality  greyish in colour  the address   sir henry      baskerville  northumberland hotel   was printed in rough      characters  the post mark  charing cross   and the date of      posting the preceding evening        who knew that you were going to the northumberland hotel   asked      holmes  glancing keenly across at our visitor        no one could have known  we only decided after i met dr       mortimer         but dr  mortimer was no doubt already stopping there         no  i had been staying with a friend   said the doctor        there was no possible indication that we intended to go to this      hotel         hum  someone seems to be very deeply interested in your      movements   out of the envelope he took a half sheet of foolscap      paper folded into four  this he opened and spread flat upon the      table  across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed      by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it  it ran         as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor       the word  moor  only was printed in ink        now   said sir henry baskerville   perhaps you will tell me  mr       holmes  what in thunder is the meaning of that  and who it is      that takes so much interest in my affairs         what do you make of it  dr  mortimer  you must allow that there      is nothing supernatural about this  at any rate         no  sir  but it might very well come from someone who was      convinced that the business is supernatural         what business   asked sir henry sharply   it seems to me that      all you gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own      affairs         you shall share our knowledge before you leave this room  sir      henry  i promise you that   said sherlock holmes   we will      confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this      very interesting document  which must have been put together and      posted yesterday evening  have you yesterday s  times   watson         it is here in the corner         might i trouble you for it the inside page  please  with the      leading articles   he glanced swiftly over it  running his eyes      up and down the columns   capital article this on free trade       permit me to give you an extract from it       you may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff  but     it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run     keep away wealth from the country  diminish the value of our     imports  and lower the general conditions of life in this island         what do you think of that  watson   cried holmes in high glee       rubbing his hands together with satisfaction   don t you think      that is an admirable sentiment        dr  mortimer looked at holmes with an air of professional      interest  and sir henry baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark      eyes upon me        i don t know much about the tariff and things of that kind        said he   but it seems to me we ve got a bit off the trail so far      as that note is concerned         on the contrary  i think we are particularly hot upon the trail       sir henry  watson here knows more about my methods than you do       but i fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of      this sentence         no  i confess that i see no connection         and yet  my dear watson  there is so very close a connection      that the one is extracted out of the other   you    your         your    life    reason    value    keep away    from the   don t      you see now whence these words have been taken         by thunder  you re right  well  if that isn t smart   cried sir      henry        if any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that       keep away  and  from the  are cut out in one piece         well  now so it is         really  mr  holmes  this exceeds anything which i could have      imagined   said dr  mortimer  gazing at my friend in amazement        i could understand anyone saying that the words were from a      newspaper  but that you should name which  and add that it came      from the leading article  is really one of the most remarkable      things which i have ever known  how did you do it         i presume  doctor  that you could tell the skull of a negro from      that of an esquimau         most certainly         but how         because that is my special hobby  the differences are obvious       the supra orbital crest  the facial angle  the maxillary curve       the         but this is my special hobby  and the differences are equally      obvious  there is as much difference to my eyes between the      leaded bourgeois type of a  times  article and the slovenly print      of an evening half penny paper as there could be between your      negro and your esquimau  the detection of types is one of the      most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in      crime  though i confess that once when i was very young i      confused the  leeds mercury  with the  western morning news   but      a  times  leader is entirely distinctive  and these words could      have been taken from nothing else  as it was done yesterday the      strong probability was that we should find the words in      yesterday s issue         so far as i can follow you  then  mr  holmes   said sir henry      baskerville   someone cut out this message with a scissors         nail scissors   said holmes   you can see that it was a very      short bladed scissors  since the cutter had to take two snips      over  keep away          that is so  someone  then  cut out the message with a pair of      short bladed scissors  pasted it with paste         gum   said holmes        with gum on to the paper  but i want to know why the word  moor       should have been written         because he could not find it in print  the other words were all      simple and might be found in any issue  but  moor  would be less      common         why  of course  that would explain it  have you read anything      else in this message  mr  holmes         there are one or two indications  and yet the utmost pains have      been taken to remove all clues  the address  you observe is      printed in rough characters  but the  times  is a paper which is      seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated  we      may take it  therefore  that the letter was composed by an      educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one  and his      effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing      might be known  or come to be known  by you  again  you will      observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line  but      that some are much higher than others   life   for example is      quite out of its proper place  that may point to carelessness or      it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter       on the whole i incline to the latter view  since the matter was      evidently important  and it is unlikely that the composer of such      a letter would be careless  if he were in a hurry it opens up the      interesting question why he should be in a hurry  since any      letter posted up to early morning would reach sir henry before he      would leave his hotel  did the composer fear an interruption and      from whom         we are coming now rather into the region of guesswork   said dr       mortimer        say  rather  into the region where we balance probabilities and      choose the most likely  it is the scientific use of the      imagination  but we have always some material basis on which to      start our speculation  now  you would call it a guess  no doubt       but i am almost certain that this address has been written in a      hotel         how in the world can you say that         if you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and      the ink have given the writer trouble  the pen has spluttered      twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short      address  showing that there was very little ink in the bottle       now  a private pen or ink bottle is seldom allowed to be in such      a state  and the combination of the two must be quite rare  but      you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen  where it is rare to get      anything else  yes  i have very little hesitation in saying that      could we examine the waste paper baskets of the hotels around      charing cross until we found the remains of the mutilated  times       leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent      this singular message  halloa  halloa  what s this        he was carefully examining the foolscap  upon which the words      were pasted  holding it only an inch or two from his eyes        well         nothing   said he  throwing it down   it is a blank half sheet      of paper  without even a water mark upon it  i think we have      drawn as much as we can from this curious letter  and now  sir      henry  has anything else of interest happened to you since you      have been in london         why  no  mr  holmes  i think not         you have not observed anyone follow or watch you         i seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel        said our visitor   why in thunder should anyone follow or watch      me         we are coming to that  you have nothing else to report to us      before we go into this matter         well  it depends upon what you think worth reporting         i think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth      reporting        sir henry smiled   i don t know much of british life yet  for i      have spent nearly all my time in the states and in canada  but i      hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary      routine of life over here         you have lost one of your boots         my dear sir   cried dr  mortimer   it is only mislaid  you will      find it when you return to the hotel  what is the use of      troubling mr  holmes with trifles of this kind         well  he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine         exactly   said holmes   however foolish the incident may seem       you have lost one of your boots  you say         well  mislaid it  anyhow  i put them both outside my door last      night  and there was only one in the morning  i could get no      sense out of the chap who cleans them  the worst of it is that i      only bought the pair last night in the strand  and i have never      had them on         if you have never worn them  why did you put them out to be      cleaned         they were tan boots and had never been varnished  that was why i      put them out         then i understand that on your arrival in london yesterday you      went out at once and bought a pair of boots         i did a good deal of shopping  dr  mortimer here went round with      me  you see  if i am to be squire down there i must dress the      part  and it may be that i have got a little careless in my ways      out west  among other things i bought these brown boots gave six      dollars for them and had one stolen before ever i had them on my      feet         it seems a singularly useless thing to steal   said sherlock      holmes   i confess that i share dr  mortimer s belief that it      will not be long before the missing boot is found         and  now  gentlemen   said the baronet with decision   it seems      to me that i have spoken quite enough about the little that i      know  it is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full      account of what we are all driving at         your request is a very reasonable one   holmes answered   dr       mortimer  i think you could not do better than to tell your story      as you told it to us        thus encouraged  our scientific friend drew his papers from his      pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the      morning before  sir henry baskerville listened with the deepest      attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise        well  i seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance        said he when the long narrative was finished   of course  i ve      heard of the hound ever since i was in the nursery  it s the pet      story of the family  though i never thought of taking it      seriously before  but as to my uncle s death well  it all seems      boiling up in my head  and i can t get it clear yet  you don t      seem quite to have made up your mind whether it s a case for a      policeman or a clergyman         precisely         and now there s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel  i      suppose that fits into its place         it seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what      goes on upon the moor   said dr  mortimer        and also   said holmes   that someone is not ill disposed      towards you  since they warn you of danger         or it may be that they wish  for their own purposes  to scare me      away         well  of course  that is possible also  i am very much indebted      to you  dr  mortimer  for introducing me to a problem which      presents several interesting alternatives  but the practical      point which we now have to decide  sir henry  is whether it is or      is not advisable for you to go to baskerville hall         why should i not go         there seems to be danger         do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger      from human beings         well  that is what we have to find out         whichever it is  my answer is fixed  there is no devil in hell       mr  holmes  and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me      from going to the home of my own people  and you may take that to      be my final answer   his dark brows knitted and his face flushed      to a dusky red as he spoke  it was evident that the fiery temper      of the baskervilles was not extinct in this their last      representative   meanwhile   said he   i have hardly had time to      think over all that you have told me  it s a big thing for a man      to have to understand and to decide at one sitting  i should like      to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind  now  look      here  mr  holmes  it s half past eleven now and i am going back      right away to my hotel  suppose you and your friend  dr  watson       come round and lunch with us at two  i ll be able to tell you      more clearly then how this thing strikes me         is that convenient to you  watson         perfectly         then you may expect us  shall i have a cab called         i d prefer to walk  for this affair has flurried me rather         i ll join you in a walk  with pleasure   said his companion        then we meet again at two o clock  au revoir  and good morning        we heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang      of the front door  in an instant holmes had changed from the      languid dreamer to the man of action        your hat and boots  watson  quick  not a moment to lose   he      rushed into his room in his dressing gown and was back again in a      few seconds in a frock coat  we hurried together down the stairs      and into the street  dr  mortimer and baskerville were still      visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of      oxford street        shall i run on and stop them         not for the world  my dear watson  i am perfectly satisfied with      your company if you will tolerate mine  our friends are wise  for      it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk        he quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which      divided us by about half  then  still keeping a hundred yards      behind  we followed into oxford street and so down regent street       once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window  upon      which holmes did the same  an instant afterwards he gave a little      cry of satisfaction  and  following the direction of his eager      eyes  i saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted      on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward      again        there s our man  watson  come along  we ll have a good look at      him  if we can do no more        at that instant i was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of      piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab       instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up  something was screamed      to the driver  and the cab flew madly off down regent street       holmes looked eagerly round for another  but no empty one was in      sight  then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the      traffic  but the start was too great  and already the cab was out      of sight        there now   said holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white      with vexation from the tide of vehicles   was ever such bad luck      and such bad management  too  watson  watson  if you are an      honest man you will record this also and set it against my      successes         who was the man         i have not an idea         a spy         well  it was evident from what we have heard that baskerville      has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in      town  how else could it be known so quickly that it was the      northumberland hotel which he had chosen  if they had followed      him the first day i argued that they would follow him also the      second  you may have observed that i twice strolled over to the      window while dr  mortimer was reading his legend         yes  i remember         i was looking out for loiterers in the street  but i saw none       we are dealing with a clever man  watson  this matter cuts very      deep  and though i have not finally made up my mind whether it is      a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us  i      am conscious always of power and design  when our friends left i      at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their      invisible attendant  so wily was he that he had not trusted      himself upon foot  but he had availed himself of a cab so that he      could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice       his method had the additional advantage that if they were to take      a cab he was all ready to follow them  it has  however  one      obvious disadvantage         it puts him in the power of the cabman         exactly         what a pity we did not get the number         my dear watson  clumsy as i have been  you surely do not      seriously imagine that i neglected to get the number  no       is      our man  but that is no use to us for the moment         i fail to see how you could have done more         on observing the cab i should have instantly turned and walked      in the other direction  i should then at my leisure have hired a      second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance  or       better still  have driven to the northumberland hotel and waited      there  when our unknown had followed baskerville home we should      have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and      seeing where he made for  as it is  by an indiscreet eagerness       which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and      energy by our opponent  we have betrayed ourselves and lost our      man        we had been sauntering slowly down regent street during this      conversation  and dr  mortimer  with his companion  had long      vanished in front of us        there is no object in our following them   said holmes   the      shadow has departed and will not return  we must see what further      cards we have in our hands and play them with decision  could you      swear to that man s face within the cab         i could swear only to the beard         and so could i from which i gather that in all probability it      was a false one  a clever man upon so delicate an errand has no      use for a beard save to conceal his features  come in here       watson        he turned into one of the district messenger offices  where he      was warmly greeted by the manager        ah  wilson  i see you have not forgotten the little case in      which i had the good fortune to help you         no  sir  indeed i have not  you saved my good name  and perhaps      my life         my dear fellow  you exaggerate  i have some recollection       wilson  that you had among your boys a lad named cartwright  who      showed some ability during the investigation         yes  sir  he is still with us         could you ring him up  thank you  and i should be glad to have      change of this five pound note        a lad of fourteen  with a bright  keen face  had obeyed the      summons of the manager  he stood now gazing with great reverence      at the famous detective        let me have the hotel directory   said holmes   thank you  now       cartwright  there are the names of twenty three hotels here  all      in the immediate neighbourhood of charing cross  do you see         yes  sir         you will visit each of these in turn         yes  sir         you will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one      shilling  here are twenty three shillings         yes  sir         you will tell him that you want to see the waste paper of      yesterday  you will say that an important telegram has miscarried      and that you are looking for it  you understand         yes  sir         but what you are really looking for is the centre page of the       times  with some holes cut in it with scissors  here is a copy      of the  times   it is this page  you could easily recognize it       could you not         yes  sir         in each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter       to whom also you will give a shilling  here are twenty three      shillings  you will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of      the twenty three that the waste of the day before has been burned      or removed  in the three other cases you will be shown a heap of      paper and you will look for this page of the  times  among it       the odds are enormously against your finding it  there are ten      shillings over in case of emergencies  let me have a report by      wire at baker street before evening  and now  watson  it only      remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman       no        and then we will drop into one of the bond street      picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the      hotel  ',\n",
       " 'three broken threads      sherlock holmes had  in a very remarkable degree  the power of      detaching his mind at will  for two hours the strange business in      which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten  and he was      entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern belgian masters       he would talk of nothing but art  of which he had the crudest      ideas  from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at      the northumberland hotel        sir henry baskerville is upstairs expecting you   said the      clerk   he asked me to show you up at once when you came         have you any objection to my looking at your register   said      holmes        not in the least        the book showed that two names had been added after that of      baskerville  one was theophilus johnson and family  of newcastle       the other mrs  oldmore and maid  of high lodge  alton        surely that must be the same johnson whom i used to know   said      holmes to the porter   a lawyer  is he not  grey headed  and      walks with a limp         no  sir  this is mr  johnson  the coal owner  a very active      gentleman  not older than yourself         surely you are mistaken about his trade         no  sir  he has used this hotel for many years  and he is very      well known to us         ah  that settles it  mrs  oldmore  too  i seem to remember the      name  excuse my curiosity  but often in calling upon one friend      one finds another         she is an invalid lady  sir  her husband was once mayor of      gloucester  she always comes to us when she is in town         thank you  i am afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance  we have      established a most important fact by these questions  watson   he      continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together   we know      now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not      settled down in his own hotel  that means that while they are  as      we have seen  very anxious to watch him  they are equally anxious      that he should not see them  now  this is a most suggestive      fact         what does it suggest         it suggests halloa  my dear fellow  what on earth is the      matter        as we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against sir      henry baskerville himself  his face was flushed with anger  and      he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands  so furious was      he that he was hardly articulate  and when he did speak it was in      a much broader and more western dialect than any which we had      heard from him in the morning        seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel   he      cried   they ll find they ve started in to monkey with the wrong      man unless they are careful  by thunder  if that chap can t find      my missing boot there will be trouble  i can take a joke with the      best  mr  holmes  but they ve got a bit over the mark this time         still looking for your boot         yes  sir  and mean to find it         but  surely  you said that it was a new brown boot         so it was  sir  and now it s an old black one         what  you don t mean to say          that s just what i do mean to say  i only had three pairs in the      world the new brown  the old black  and the patent leathers       which i am wearing  last night they took one of my brown ones       and today they have sneaked one of the black  well  have you got      it  speak out  man  and don t stand staring        an agitated german waiter had appeared upon the scene        no  sir  i have made inquiry all over the hotel  but i can hear      no word of it         well  either that boot comes back before sundown or i ll see the      manager and tell him that i go right straight out of this hotel         it shall be found  sir i promise you that if you will have a      little patience it will be found         mind it is  for it s the last thing of mine that i ll lose in      this den of thieves  well  well  mr  holmes  you ll excuse my      troubling you about such a trifle         i think it s well worth troubling about         why  you look very serious over it         how do you explain it         i just don t attempt to explain it  it seems the very maddest       queerest thing that ever happened to me         the queerest perhaps   said holmes thoughtfully        what do you make of it yourself         well  i don t profess to understand it yet  this case of yours      is very complex  sir henry  when taken in conjunction with your      uncle s death i am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of      capital importance which i have handled there is one which cuts      so deep  but we hold several threads in our hands  and the odds      are that one or other of them guides us to the truth  we may      waste time in following the wrong one  but sooner or later we      must come upon the right        we had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the      business which had brought us together  it was in the private      sitting room to which we afterwards repaired that holmes asked      baskerville what were his intentions        to go to baskerville hall         and when         at the end of the week         on the whole   said holmes   i think that your decision is a      wise one  i have ample evidence that you are being dogged in      london  and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult      to discover who these people are or what their object can be  if      their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief  and we      should be powerless to prevent it  you did not know  dr       mortimer  that you were followed this morning from my house        dr  mortimer started violently   followed  by whom         that  unfortunately  is what i cannot tell you  have you among      your neighbours or acquaintances on dartmoor any man with a      black  full beard         no or  let me see why  yes  barrymore  sir charles s butler  is      a man with a full  black beard         ha  where is barrymore         he is in charge of the hall         we had best ascertain if he is really there  or if by any      possibility he might be in london         how can you do that         give me a telegraph form   is all ready for sir henry   that      will do  address to mr  barrymore  baskerville hall  what is the      nearest telegraph office  grimpen  very good  we will send a      second wire to the postmaster  grimpen   telegram to mr       barrymore to be delivered into his own hand  if absent  please      return wire to sir henry baskerville  northumberland hotel   that      should let us know before evening whether barrymore is at his      post in devonshire or not         that s so   said baskerville   by the way  dr  mortimer  who is      this barrymore  anyhow         he is the son of the old caretaker  who is dead  they have      looked after the hall for four generations now  so far as i know       he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the      county         at the same time   said baskerville   it s clear enough that so      long as there are none of the family at the hall these people      have a mighty fine home and nothing to do         that is true         did barrymore profit at all by sir charles s will   asked      holmes        he and his wife had five hundred pounds each         ha  did they know that they would receive this         yes  sir charles was very fond of talking about the provisions      of his will         that is very interesting         i hope   said dr  mortimer   that you do not look with      suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from sir      charles  for i also had a thousand pounds left to me         indeed  and anyone else         there were many insignificant sums to individuals  and a large      number of public charities  the residue all went to sir henry         and how much was the residue         seven hundred and forty thousand pounds        holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise   i had no idea that so      gigantic a sum was involved   said he        sir charles had the reputation of being rich  but we did not      know how very rich he was until we came to examine his      securities  the total value of the estate was close on to a      million         dear me  it is a stake for which a man might well play a      desperate game  and one more question  dr  mortimer  supposing      that anything happened to our young friend here you will forgive      the unpleasant hypothesis  who would inherit the estate         since rodger baskerville  sir charles s younger brother died      unmarried  the estate would descend to the desmonds  who are      distant cousins  james desmond is an elderly clergyman in      westmoreland         thank you  these details are all of great interest  have you met      mr  james desmond         yes  he once came down to visit sir charles  he is a man of      venerable appearance and of saintly life  i remember that he      refused to accept any settlement from sir charles  though he      pressed it upon him         and this man of simple tastes would be the heir to sir charles s      thousands         he would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed  he      would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed      otherwise by the present owner  who can  of course  do what he      likes with it         and have you made your will  sir henry         no  mr  holmes  i have not  i ve had no time  for it was only      yesterday that i learned how matters stood  but in any case i      feel that the money should go with the title and estate  that was      my poor uncle s idea  how is the owner going to restore the      glories of the baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up      the property  house  land  and dollars must go together         quite so  well  sir henry  i am of one mind with you as to the      advisability of your going down to devonshire without delay       there is only one provision which i must make  you certainly must      not go alone         dr  mortimer returns with me         but dr  mortimer has his practice to attend to  and his house is      miles away from yours  with all the goodwill in the world he may      be unable to help you  no  sir henry  you must take with you      someone  a trusty man  who will be always by your side         is it possible that you could come yourself  mr  holmes         if matters came to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in      person  but you can understand that  with my extensive consulting      practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many      quarters  it is impossible for me to be absent from london for an      indefinite time  at the present instant one of the most revered      names in england is being besmirched by a blackmailer  and only i      can stop a disastrous scandal  you will see how impossible it is      for me to go to dartmoor         whom would you recommend  then        holmes laid his hand upon my arm   if my friend would undertake      it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when      you are in a tight place  no one can say so more confidently than      i        the proposition took me completely by surprise  but before i had      time to answer  baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it      heartily        well  now  that is real kind of you  dr  watson   said he   you      see how it is with me  and you know just as much about the matter      as i do  if you will come down to baskerville hall and see me      through i ll never forget it        the promise of adventure had always a fascination for me  and i      was complimented by the words of holmes and by the eagerness with      which the baronet hailed me as a companion        i will come  with pleasure   said i   i do not know how i could      employ my time better         and you will report very carefully to me   said holmes   when a      crisis comes  as it will do  i will direct how you shall act  i      suppose that by saturday all might be ready         would that suit dr  watson         perfectly         then on saturday  unless you hear to the contrary  we shall meet      at the ten thirty train from paddington        we had risen to depart when baskerville gave a cry of triumph       and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown      boot from under a cabinet        my missing boot   he cried        may all our difficulties vanish as easily   said sherlock      holmes        but it is a very singular thing   dr  mortimer remarked   i      searched this room carefully before lunch         and so did i   said baskerville   every inch of it         there was certainly no boot in it then         in that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were      lunching        the german was sent for but professed to know nothing of the      matter  nor could any inquiry clear it up  another item had been      added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small      mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly  setting      aside the whole grim story of sir charles s death  we had a line      of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days       which included the receipt of the printed letter  the      black bearded spy in the hansom  the loss of the new brown boot       the loss of the old black boot  and now the return of the new      brown boot  holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to      baker street  and i knew from his drawn brows and keen face that      his mind  like my own  was busy in endeavouring to frame some      scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected      episodes could be fitted  all afternoon and late into the evening      he sat lost in tobacco and thought       just before dinner two telegrams were handed in  the first ran       have just heard that barrymore is at the hall  baskerville       the second       visited twenty three hotels as directed  but sorry to report      unable to trace cut sheet of  times   cartwright        there go two of my threads  watson  there is nothing more      stimulating than a case where everything goes against you  we      must cast round for another scent         we have still the cabman who drove the spy         exactly  i have wired to get his name and address from the      official registry  i should not be surprised if this were an      answer to my question        the ring at the bell proved to be something even more      satisfactory than an answer  however  for the door opened and a      rough looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself        i got a message from the head office that a gent at this address      had been inquiring for no         said he   i ve driven my cab      this seven years and never a word of complaint  i came here      straight from the yard to ask you to your face what you had      against me         i have nothing in the world against you  my good man   said      holmes   on the contrary  i have half a sovereign for you if you      will give me a clear answer to my questions         well  i ve had a good day and no mistake   said the cabman with      a grin   what was it you wanted to ask  sir         first of all your name and address  in case i want you again         john clayton    turpey street  the borough  my cab is out of      shipley s yard  near waterloo station        sherlock holmes made a note of it        now  clayton  tell me all about the fare who came and watched      this house at ten o clock this morning and afterwards followed      the two gentlemen down regent street        the man looked surprised and a little embarrassed   why  there s      no good my telling you things  for you seem to know as much as i      do already   said he   the truth is that the gentleman told me      that he was a detective and that i was to say nothing about him      to anyone         my good fellow  this is a very serious business  and you may      find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide      anything from me  you say that your fare told you that he was a      detective         yes  he did         when did he say this         when he left me         did he say anything more         he mentioned his name        holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me   oh  he mentioned      his name  did he  that was imprudent  what was the name that he      mentioned         his name   said the cabman   was mr  sherlock holmes        never have i seen my friend more completely taken aback than by      the cabman s reply  for an instant he sat in silent amazement       then he burst into a hearty laugh        a touch  watson an undeniable touch   said he   i feel a foil as      quick and supple as my own  he got home upon me very prettily      that time  so his name was sherlock holmes  was it         yes  sir  that was the gentleman s name         excellent  tell me where you picked him up and all that      occurred         he hailed me at half past nine in trafalgar square  he said that      he was a detective  and he offered me two guineas if i would do      exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions  i was glad      enough to agree  first we drove down to the northumberland hotel      and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from      the rank  we followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near      here         this very door   said holmes        well  i couldn t be sure of that  but i dare say my fare knew      all about it  we pulled up halfway down the street and waited an      hour and a half  then the two gentlemen passed us  walking  and      we followed down baker street and along         i know   said holmes        until we got three quarters down regent street  then my      gentleman threw up the trap  and he cried that i should drive      right away to waterloo station as hard as i could go  i whipped      up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes  then he paid      up his two guineas  like a good one  and away he went into the      station  only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said        it might interest you to know that you have been driving mr       sherlock holmes   that s how i come to know the name         i see  and you saw no more of him         not after he went into the station         and how would you describe mr  sherlock holmes        the cabman scratched his head   well  he wasn t altogether such      an easy gentleman to describe  i d put him at forty years of age       and he was of a middle height  two or three inches shorter than      you  sir  he was dressed like a toff  and he had a black beard       cut square at the end  and a pale face  i don t know as i could      say more than that         colour of his eyes         no  i can t say that         nothing more that you can remember         no  sir  nothing         well  then  here is your half sovereign  there s another one      waiting for you if you can bring any more information       good night         good night  sir  and thank you        john clayton departed chuckling  and holmes turned to me with a      shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile        snap goes our third thread  and we end where we began   said he        the cunning rascal  he knew our number  knew that sir henry      baskerville had consulted me  spotted who i was in regent street       conjectured that i had got the number of the cab and would lay my      hands on the driver  and so sent back this audacious message  i      tell you  watson  this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of      our steel  i ve been checkmated in london  i can only wish you      better luck in devonshire  but i m not easy in my mind about it         about what         about sending you  it s an ugly business  watson  an ugly      dangerous business  and the more i see of it the less i like it       yes  my dear fellow  you may laugh  but i give you my word that i      shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in baker      street once more  ',\n",
       " 'baskerville hall      sir henry baskerville and dr  mortimer were ready upon the      appointed day  and we started as arranged for devonshire  mr       sherlock holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last      parting injunctions and advice        i will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions       watson   said he   i wish you simply to report facts in the      fullest possible manner to me  and you can leave me to do the      theorizing         what sort of facts   i asked        anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon      the case  and especially the relations between young baskerville      and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death      of sir charles  i have made some inquiries myself in the last few      days  but the results have  i fear  been negative  one thing only      appears to be certain  and that is that mr  james desmond  who is      the next heir  is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable      disposition  so that this persecution does not arise from him  i      really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our      calculations  there remain the people who will actually surround      sir henry baskerville upon the moor         would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this      barrymore couple         by no means  you could not make a greater mistake  if they are      innocent it would be a cruel injustice  and if they are guilty we      should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them  no       no  we will preserve them upon our list of suspects  then there      is a groom at the hall  if i remember right  there are two      moorland farmers  there is our friend dr  mortimer  whom i      believe to be entirely honest  and there is his wife  of whom we      know nothing  there is this naturalist  stapleton  and there is      his sister  who is said to be a young lady of attractions  there      is mr  frankland  of lafter hall  who is also an unknown factor       and there are one or two other neighbours  these are the folk who      must be your very special study         i will do my best         you have arms  i suppose         yes  i thought it as well to take them         most certainly  keep your revolver near you night and day  and      never relax your precautions        our friends had already secured a first class carriage and were      waiting for us upon the platform        no  we have no news of any kind   said dr  mortimer in answer to      my friend s questions   i can swear to one thing  and that is      that we have not been shadowed during the last two days  we have      never gone out without keeping a sharp watch  and no one could      have escaped our notice         you have always kept together  i presume         except yesterday afternoon  i usually give up one day to pure      amusement when i come to town  so i spent it at the museum of the      college of surgeons         and i went to look at the folk in the park   said baskerville        but we had no trouble of any kind         it was imprudent  all the same   said holmes  shaking his head      and looking very grave   i beg  sir henry  that you will not go      about alone  some great misfortune will befall you if you do  did      you get your other boot         no  sir  it is gone forever         indeed  that is very interesting  well  good bye   he added as      the train began to glide down the platform   bear in mind  sir      henry  one of the phrases in that queer old legend which dr       mortimer has read to us  and avoid the moor in those hours of      darkness when the powers of evil are exalted        i looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and      saw the tall  austere figure of holmes standing motionless and      gazing after us       the journey was a swift and pleasant one  and i spent it in      making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in      playing with dr  mortimer s spaniel  in a very few hours the      brown earth had become ruddy  the brick had changed to granite       and red cows grazed in well hedged fields where the lush grasses      and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer  if a damper       climate  young baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and      cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features      of the devon scenery        i ve been over a good part of the world since i left it  dr       watson   said he   but i have never seen a place to compare with      it         i never saw a devonshire man who did not swear by his county   i      remarked        it depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the      county   said dr  mortimer   a glance at our friend here reveals      the rounded head of the celt  which carries inside it the celtic      enthusiasm and power of attachment  poor sir charles s head was      of a very rare type  half gaelic  half ivernian in its      characteristics  but you were very young when you last saw      baskerville hall  were you not         i was a boy in my teens at the time of my father s death and had      never seen the hall  for he lived in a little cottage on the      south coast  thence i went straight to a friend in america  i      tell you it is all as new to me as it is to dr  watson  and i m      as keen as possible to see the moor         are you  then your wish is easily granted  for there is your      first sight of the moor   said dr  mortimer  pointing out of the      carriage window       over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood      there rose in the distance a grey  melancholy hill  with a      strange jagged summit  dim and vague in the distance  like some      fantastic landscape in a dream  baskerville sat for a long time       his eyes fixed upon it  and i read upon his eager face how much      it meant to him  this first sight of that strange spot where the      men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so      deep  there he sat  with his tweed suit and his american accent       in the corner of a prosaic railway carriage  and yet as i looked      at his dark and expressive face i felt more than ever how true a      descendant he was of that long line of high blooded  fiery  and      masterful men  there were pride  valour  and strength in his      thick brows  his sensitive nostrils  and his large hazel eyes  if      on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should      lie before us  this was at least a comrade for whom one might      venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely      share it       the train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all      descended  outside  beyond the low  white fence  a wagonette with      a pair of cobs was waiting  our coming was evidently a great      event  for station master and porters clustered round us to carry      out our luggage  it was a sweet  simple country spot  but i was      surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly      men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and      glanced keenly at us as we passed  the coachman  a hard faced       gnarled little fellow  saluted sir henry baskerville  and in a      few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad  white road       rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us  and old      gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage  but      behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever  dark      against the evening sky  the long  gloomy curve of the moor       broken by the jagged and sinister hills       the wagonette swung round into a side road  and we curved upward      through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels  high banks on      either side  heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart s tongue      ferns  bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light      of the sinking sun  still steadily rising  we passed over a      narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed      swiftly down  foaming and roaring amid the grey boulders  both      road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak      and fir  at every turn baskerville gave an exclamation of      delight  looking eagerly about him and asking countless      questions  to his eyes all seemed beautiful  but to me a tinge of      melancholy lay upon the countryside  which bore so clearly the      mark of the waning year  yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and      fluttered down upon us as we passed  the rattle of our wheels      died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation sad      gifts  as it seemed to me  for nature to throw before the      carriage of the returning heir of the baskervilles        halloa   cried dr  mortimer   what is this        a steep curve of heath clad land  an outlying spur of the moor       lay in front of us  on the summit  hard and clear like an      equestrian statue upon its pedestal  was a mounted soldier  dark      and stern  his rifle poised ready over his forearm  he was      watching the road along which we travelled        what is this  perkins   asked dr  mortimer       our driver half turned in his seat   there s a convict escaped      from princetown  sir  he s been out three days now  and the      warders watch every road and every station  but they ve had no      sight of him yet  the farmers about here don t like it  sir  and      that s a fact         well  i understand that they get five pounds if they can give      information         yes  sir  but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing      compared to the chance of having your throat cut  you see  it      isn t like any ordinary convict  this is a man that would stick      at nothing         who is he  then         it is selden  the notting hill murderer        i remembered the case well  for it was one in which holmes had      taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the      crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions      of the assassin  the commutation of his death sentence had been      due to some doubts as to his complete sanity  so atrocious was      his conduct  our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us      rose the huge expanse of the moor  mottled with gnarled and      craggy cairns and tors  a cold wind swept down from it and set us      shivering  somewhere there  on that desolate plain  was lurking      this fiendish man  hiding in a burrow like a wild beast  his      heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast      him out  it needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness      of the barren waste  the chilling wind  and the darkling sky       even baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely      around him       we had left the fertile country behind and beneath us  we looked      back on it now  the slanting rays of a low sun turning the      streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new      turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands  the      road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and      olive slopes  sprinkled with giant boulders  now and then we      passed a moorland cottage  walled and roofed with stone  with no      creeper to break its harsh outline  suddenly we looked down into      a cuplike depression  patched with stunted oaks and firs which      had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm  two      high  narrow towers rose over the trees  the driver pointed with      his whip        baskerville hall   said he       its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and      shining eyes  a few minutes later we had reached the lodge gates       a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron  with weather bitten      pillars on either side  blotched with lichens  and surmounted by      the boars  heads of the baskervilles  the lodge was a ruin of      black granite and bared ribs of rafters  but facing it was a new      building  half constructed  the first fruit of sir charles s      south african gold       through the gateway we passed into the avenue  where the wheels      were again hushed amid the leaves  and the old trees shot their      branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads  baskerville shuddered      as he looked up the long  dark drive to where the house glimmered      like a ghost at the farther end        was it here   he asked in a low voice        no  no  the yew alley is on the other side        the young heir glanced round with a gloomy face        it s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in      such a place as this   said he   it s enough to scare any man       i ll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months       and you won t know it again  with a thousand candle power swan      and edison right here in front of the hall door        the avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf  and the house lay      before us  in the fading light i could see that the centre was a      heavy block of building from which a porch projected  the whole      front was draped in ivy  with a patch clipped bare here and there      where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil       from this central block rose the twin towers  ancient       crenelated  and pierced with many loopholes  to right and left of      the turrets were more modern wings of black granite  a dull light      shone through heavy mullioned windows  and from the high chimneys      which rose from the steep  high angled roof there sprang a single      black column of smoke        welcome  sir henry  welcome to baskerville hall        a tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the      door of the wagonette  the figure of a woman was silhouetted      against the yellow light of the hall  she came out and helped the      man to hand down our bags        you don t mind my driving straight home  sir henry   said dr       mortimer   my wife is expecting me         surely you will stay and have some dinner         no  i must go  i shall probably find some work awaiting me  i      would stay to show you over the house  but barrymore will be a      better guide than i  good bye  and never hesitate night or day to      send for me if i can be of service        the wheels died away down the drive while sir henry and i turned      into the hall  and the door clanged heavily behind us  it was a      fine apartment in which we found ourselves  large  lofty  and      heavily raftered with huge baulks of age blackened oak  in the      great old fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a      log fire crackled and snapped  sir henry and i held out our hands      to it  for we were numb from our long drive  then we gazed round      us at the high  thin window of old stained glass  the oak      panelling  the stags  heads  the coats of arms upon the walls       all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp        it s just as i imagined it   said sir henry   is it not the very      picture of an old family home  to think that this should be the      same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived       it strikes me solemn to think of it        i saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed      about him  the light beat upon him where he stood  but long      shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above      him  barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms       he stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a      well trained servant  he was a remarkable looking man  tall       handsome  with a square black beard and pale  distinguished      features        would you wish dinner to be served at once  sir         is it ready         in a very few minutes  sir  you will find hot water in your      rooms  my wife and i will be happy  sir henry  to stay with you      until you have made your fresh arrangements  but you will      understand that under the new conditions this house will require      a considerable staff         what new conditions         i only meant  sir  that sir charles led a very retired life  and      we were able to look after his wants  you would  naturally  wish      to have more company  and so you will need changes in your      household         do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave         only when it is quite convenient to you  sir         but your family have been with us for several generations  have      they not  i should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an      old family connection        i seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler s white      face        i feel that also  sir  and so does my wife  but to tell the      truth  sir  we were both very much attached to sir charles  and      his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very      painful to us  i fear that we shall never again be easy in our      minds at baskerville hall         but what do you intend to do         i have no doubt  sir  that we shall succeed in establishing      ourselves in some business  sir charles s generosity has given us      the means to do so  and now  sir  perhaps i had best show you to      your rooms        a square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall       approached by a double stair  from this central point two long      corridors extended the whole length of the building  from which      all the bedrooms opened  my own was in the same wing as      baskerville s and almost next door to it  these rooms appeared to      be much more modern than the central part of the house  and the      bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the      sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind       but the dining room which opened out of the hall was a place of      shadow and gloom  it was a long chamber with a step separating      the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for      their dependents  at one end a minstrel s gallery overlooked it       black beams shot across above our heads  with a smoke darkened      ceiling beyond them  with rows of flaring torches to light it up       and the colour and rude hilarity of an old time banquet  it might      have softened  but now  when two black clothed gentlemen sat in      the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp  one s voice      became hushed and one s spirit subdued  a dim line of ancestors       in every variety of dress  from the elizabethan knight to the      buck of the regency  stared down upon us and daunted us by their      silent company  we talked little  and i for one was glad when the      meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern      billiard room and smoke a cigarette        my word  it isn t a very cheerful place   said sir henry   i      suppose one can tone down to it  but i feel a bit out of the      picture at present  i don t wonder that my uncle got a little      jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this  however  if      it suits you  we will retire early tonight  and perhaps things      may seem more cheerful in the morning        i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from      my window  it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of      the hall door  beyond  two copses of trees moaned and swung in a      rising wind  a half moon broke through the rifts of racing      clouds  in its cold light i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe      of rocks  and the long  low curve of the melancholy moor  i      closed the curtain  feeling that my last impression was in      keeping with the rest       and yet it was not quite the last  i found myself weary and yet      wakeful  tossing restlessly from side to side  seeking for the      sleep which would not come  far away a chiming clock struck out      the quarters of the hours  but otherwise a deathly silence lay      upon the old house  and then suddenly  in the very dead of the      night  there came a sound to my ears  clear  resonant  and      unmistakable  it was the sob of a woman  the muffled  strangling      gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow  i sat up in      bed and listened intently  the noise could not have been far away      and was certainly in the house  for half an hour i waited with      every nerve on the alert  but there came no other sound save the      chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall ',\n",
       " 'the stapletons of merripit house      the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface      from our minds the grim and grey impression which had been left      upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall  as      sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through      the high mullioned windows  throwing watery patches of colour      from the coats of arms which covered them  the dark panelling      glowed like bronze in the golden rays  and it was hard to realise      that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom      into our souls upon the evening before        i guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to      blame   said the baronet   we were tired with our journey and      chilled by our drive  so we took a grey view of the place  now we      are fresh and well  so it is all cheerful once more         and yet it was not entirely a question of imagination   i      answered   did you  for example  happen to hear someone  a woman      i think  sobbing in the night         that is curious  for i did when i was half asleep fancy that i      heard something of the sort  i waited quite a time  but there was      no more of it  so i concluded that it was all a dream         i heard it distinctly  and i am sure that it was really the sob      of a woman         we must ask about this right away   he rang the bell and asked      barrymore whether he could account for our experience  it seemed      to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler      still as he listened to his master s question        there are only two women in the house  sir henry   he answered        one is the scullery maid  who sleeps in the other wing  the      other is my wife  and i can answer for it that the sound could      not have come from her        and yet he lied as he said it  for it chanced that after      breakfast i met mrs  barrymore in the long corridor with the sun      full upon her face  she was a large  impassive  heavy featured      woman with a stern set expression of mouth  but her telltale eyes      were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids  it was she       then  who wept in the night  and if she did so her husband must      know it  yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in      declaring that it was not so  why had he done this  and why did      she weep so bitterly  already round this pale faced  handsome       black bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery      and of gloom  it was he who had been the first to discover the      body of sir charles  and we had only his word for all the      circumstances which led up to the old man s death  was it      possible that it was barrymore  after all  whom we had seen in      the cab in regent street  the beard might well have been the      same  the cabman had described a somewhat shorter man  but such      an impression might easily have been erroneous  how could i      settle the point forever  obviously the first thing to do was to      see the grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had      really been placed in barrymore s own hands  be the answer what      it might  i should at least have something to report to sherlock      holmes       sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast  so that      the time was propitious for my excursion  it was a pleasant walk      of four miles along the edge of the moor  leading me at last to a      small grey hamlet  in which two larger buildings  which proved to      be the inn and the house of dr  mortimer  stood high above the      rest  the postmaster  who was also the village grocer  had a      clear recollection of the telegram        certainly  sir   said he   i had the telegram delivered to mr       barrymore exactly as directed         who delivered it         my boy here  james  you delivered that telegram to mr  barrymore      at the hall last week  did you not         yes  father  i delivered it         into his own hands   i asked        well  he was up in the loft at the time  so that i could not put      it into his own hands  but i gave it into mrs  barrymore s hands       and she promised to deliver it at once         did you see mr  barrymore         no  sir  i tell you he was in the loft         if you didn t see him  how do you know he was in the loft         well  surely his own wife ought to know where he is   said the      postmaster testily   didn t he get the telegram  if there is any      mistake it is for mr  barrymore himself to complain        it seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther  but it was      clear that in spite of holmes s ruse we had no proof that      barrymore had not been in london all the time  suppose that it      were so suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen      sir charles alive  and the first to dog the new heir when he      returned to england  what then  was he the agent of others or had      he some sinister design of his own  what interest could he have      in persecuting the baskerville family  i thought of the strange      warning clipped out of the leading article of the  times   was      that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was      bent upon counteracting his schemes  the only conceivable motive      was that which had been suggested by sir henry  that if the      family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home      would be secured for the barrymores  but surely such an      explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the      deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible      net round the young baronet  holmes himself had said that no more      complex case had come to him in all the long series of his      sensational investigations  i prayed  as i walked back along the      grey  lonely road  that my friend might soon be freed from his      preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of      responsibility from my shoulders       suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running      feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name  i turned       expecting to see dr  mortimer  but to my surprise it was a      stranger who was pursuing me  he was a small  slim  clean shaven       prim faced man  flaxen haired and lean jawed  between thirty and      forty years of age  dressed in a grey suit and wearing a straw      hat  a tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and      he carried a green butterfly net in one of his hands        you will  i am sure  excuse my presumption  dr  watson   said he      as he came panting up to where i stood   here on the moor we are      homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions  you may      possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend  mortimer  i      am stapleton  of merripit house         your net and box would have told me as much   said i   for i      knew that mr  stapleton was a naturalist  but how did you know      me         i have been calling on mortimer  and he pointed you out to me      from the window of his surgery as you passed  as our road lay the      same way i thought that i would overtake you and introduce      myself  i trust that sir henry is none the worse for his      journey         he is very well  thank you         we were all rather afraid that after the sad death of sir      charles the new baronet might refuse to live here  it is asking      much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of      this kind  but i need not tell you that it means a very great      deal to the countryside  sir henry has  i suppose  no      superstitious fears in the matter         i do not think that it is likely         of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the      family         i have heard it         it is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here       any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a      creature upon the moor   he spoke with a smile  but i seemed to      read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously   the      story took a great hold upon the imagination of sir charles  and      i have no doubt that it led to his tragic end         but how         his nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog      might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart  i fancy      that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night      in the yew alley  i feared that some disaster might occur  for i      was very fond of the old man  and i knew that his heart was      weak         how did you know that         my friend mortimer told me         you think  then  that some dog pursued sir charles  and that he      died of fright in consequence         have you any better explanation         i have not come to any conclusion         has mr  sherlock holmes        the words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the      placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no      surprise was intended        it is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you  dr       watson   said he   the records of your detective have reached us      here  and you could not celebrate him without being known      yourself  when mortimer told me your name he could not deny your      identity  if you are here  then it follows that mr  sherlock      holmes is interesting himself in the matter  and i am naturally      curious to know what view he may take         i am afraid that i cannot answer that question         may i ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself         he cannot leave town at present  he has other cases which engage      his attention         what a pity  he might throw some light on that which is so dark      to us  but as to your own researches  if there is any possible      way in which i can be of service to you i trust that you will      command me  if i had any indication of the nature of your      suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case  i might      perhaps even now give you some aid or advice         i assure you that i am simply here upon a visit to my friend       sir henry  and that i need no help of any kind         excellent   said stapleton   you are perfectly right to be wary      and discreet  i am justly reproved for what i feel was an      unjustifiable intrusion  and i promise you that i will not      mention the matter again        we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from      the road and wound away across the moor  a steep       boulder sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone      days been cut into a granite quarry  the face which was turned      towards us formed a dark cliff  with ferns and brambles growing      in its niches  from over a distant rise there floated a grey      plume of smoke        a moderate walk along this moor path brings us to merripit      house   said he   perhaps you will spare an hour that i may have      the pleasure of introducing you to my sister        my first thought was that i should be by sir henry s side  but      then i remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his      study table was littered  it was certain that i could not help      with those  and holmes had expressly said that i should study the      neighbours upon the moor  i accepted stapleton s invitation  and      we turned together down the path        it is a wonderful place  the moor   said he  looking round over      the undulating downs  long green rollers  with crests of jagged      granite foaming up into fantastic surges   you never tire of the      moor  you cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains       it is so vast  and so barren  and so mysterious         you know it well  then         i have only been here two years  the residents would call me a      newcomer  we came shortly after sir charles settled  but my      tastes led me to explore every part of the country round  and i      should think that there are few men who know it better than i      do         is it hard to know         very hard  you see  for example  this great plain to the north      here with the queer hills breaking out of it  do you observe      anything remarkable about that         it would be a rare place for a gallop         you would naturally think so and the thought has cost several      their lives before now  you notice those bright green spots      scattered thickly over it         yes  they seem more fertile than the rest        stapleton laughed   that is the great grimpen mire   said he   a      false step yonder means death to man or beast  only yesterday i      saw one of the moor ponies wander into it  he never came out  i      saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog hole       but it sucked him down at last  even in dry seasons it is a      danger to cross it  but after these autumn rains it is an awful      place  and yet i can find my way to the very heart of it and      return alive  by george  there is another of those miserable      ponies        something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges       then a long  agonised  writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful      cry echoed over the moor  it turned me cold with horror  but my      companion s nerves seemed to be stronger than mine        it s gone   said he   the mire has him  two in two days  and      many more  perhaps  for they get in the way of going there in the      dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them      in its clutches  it s a bad place  the great grimpen mire         and you say you can penetrate it         yes  there are one or two paths which a very active man can      take  i have found them out         but why should you wish to go into so horrible a place         well  you see the hills beyond  they are really islands cut off      on all sides by the impassable mire  which has crawled round them      in the course of years  that is where the rare plants and the      butterflies are  if you have the wit to reach them         i shall try my luck some day        he looked at me with a surprised face   for god s sake put such      an idea out of your mind   said he   your blood would be upon my      head  i assure you that there would not be the least chance of      your coming back alive  it is only by remembering certain complex      landmarks that i am able to do it         halloa   i cried   what is that        a long  low moan  indescribably sad  swept over the moor  it      filled the whole air  and yet it was impossible to say whence it      came  from a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar  and then      sank back into a melancholy  throbbing murmur once again       stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face        queer place  the moor   said he        but what is it         the peasants say it is the hound of the baskervilles calling for      its prey  i ve heard it once or twice before  but never quite so      loud        i looked round  with a chill of fear in my heart  at the huge      swelling plain  mottled with the green patches of rushes  nothing      stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens  which      croaked loudly from a tor behind us        you are an educated man  you don t believe such nonsense as      that   said i   what do you think is the cause of so strange a      sound         bogs make queer noises sometimes  it s the mud settling  or the      water rising  or something         no  no  that was a living voice         well  perhaps it was  did you ever hear a bittern booming         no  i never did         it s a very rare bird practically extinct in england now  but      all things are possible upon the moor  yes  i should not be      surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last      of the bitterns         it s the weirdest  strangest thing that ever i heard in my      life         yes  it s rather an uncanny place altogether  look at the      hillside yonder  what do you make of those        the whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings of      stone  a score of them at least        what are they  sheep pens         no  they are the homes of our worthy ancestors  prehistoric man      lived thickly on the moor  and as no one in particular has lived      there since  we find all his little arrangements exactly as he      left them  these are his wigwams with the roofs off  you can even      see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go      inside        but it is quite a town  when was it inhabited         neolithic man no date         what did he do         he grazed his cattle on these slopes  and he learned to dig for      tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe  look      at the great trench in the opposite hill  that is his mark  yes       you will find some very singular points about the moor  dr       watson  oh  excuse me an instant  it is surely cyclopides        a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path  and in an      instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed      in pursuit of it  to my dismay the creature flew straight for the      great mire  and my acquaintance never paused for an instant       bounding from tuft to tuft behind it  his green net waving in the      air  his grey clothes and jerky  zigzag  irregular progress made      him not unlike some huge moth himself  i was standing watching      his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary      activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the      treacherous mire  when i heard the sound of steps and  turning      round  found a woman near me upon the path  she had come from the      direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of      merripit house  but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was      quite close       i could not doubt that this was the miss stapleton of whom i had      been told  since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor       and i remembered that i had heard someone describe her as being a      beauty  the woman who approached me was certainly that  and of a      most uncommon type  there could not have been a greater contrast      between brother and sister  for stapleton was neutral tinted       with light hair and grey eyes  while she was darker than any      brunette whom i have seen in england slim  elegant  and tall  she      had a proud  finely cut face  so regular that it might have      seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the      beautiful dark  eager eyes  with her perfect figure and elegant      dress she was  indeed  a strange apparition upon a lonely      moorland path  her eyes were on her brother as i turned  and then      she quickened her pace towards me  i had raised my hat and was      about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned      all my thoughts into a new channel        go back   she said   go straight back to london  instantly        i could only stare at her in stupid surprise  her eyes blazed at      me  and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot        why should i go back   i asked        i cannot explain   she spoke in a low  eager voice  with a      curious lisp in her utterance   but for god s sake do what i ask      you  go back and never set foot upon the moor again         but i have only just come         man  man   she cried   can you not tell when a warning is for      your own good  go back to london  start tonight  get away from      this place at all costs  hush  my brother is coming  not a word      of what i have said  would you mind getting that orchid for me      among the mare s tails yonder  we are very rich in orchids on the      moor  though  of course  you are rather late to see the beauties      of the place        stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing      hard and flushed with his exertions        halloa  beryl   said he  and it seemed to me that the tone of      his greeting was not altogether a cordial one        well  jack  you are very hot         yes  i was chasing a cyclopides  he is very rare and seldom      found in the late autumn  what a pity that i should have missed      him   he spoke unconcernedly  but his small light eyes glanced      incessantly from the girl to me        you have introduced yourselves  i can see         yes  i was telling sir henry that it was rather late for him to      see the true beauties of the moor         why  who do you think this is         i imagine that it must be sir henry baskerville         no  no   said i   only a humble commoner  but his friend  my      name is dr  watson        a flush of vexation passed over her expressive face   we have      been talking at cross purposes   said she        why  you had not very much time for talk   her brother remarked      with the same questioning eyes        i talked as if dr  watson were a resident instead of being      merely a visitor   said she   it cannot much matter to him      whether it is early or late for the orchids  but you will come      on  will you not  and see merripit house        a short walk brought us to it  a bleak moorland house  once the      farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days  but now put into      repair and turned into a modern dwelling  an orchard surrounded      it  but the trees  as is usual upon the moor  were stunted and      nipped  and the effect of the whole place was mean and      melancholy  we were admitted by a strange  wizened  rusty coated      old manservant  who seemed in keeping with the house  inside       however  there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in      which i seemed to recognize the taste of the lady  as i looked      from their windows at the interminable granite flecked moor      rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon i could not but marvel      at what could have brought this highly educated man and this      beautiful woman to live in such a place        queer spot to choose  is it not   said he as if in answer to my      thought   and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy  do we      not  beryl         quite happy   said she  but there was no ring of conviction in      her words        i had a school   said stapleton   it was in the north country       the work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and      uninteresting  but the privilege of living with youth  of helping      to mould those young minds  and of impressing them with one s own      character and ideals was very dear to me  however  the fates were      against us  a serious epidemic broke out in the school and three      of the boys died  it never recovered from the blow  and much of      my capital was irretrievably swallowed up  and yet  if it were      not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys  i      could rejoice over my own misfortune  for  with my strong tastes      for botany and zoology  i find an unlimited field of work here       and my sister is as devoted to nature as i am  all this  dr       watson  has been brought upon your head by your expression as you      surveyed the moor out of our window         it certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little      dull less for you  perhaps  than for your sister         no  no  i am never dull   said she quickly        we have books  we have our studies  and we have interesting      neighbours  dr  mortimer is a most learned man in his own line       poor sir charles was also an admirable companion  we knew him      well and miss him more than i can tell  do you think that i      should intrude if i were to call this afternoon and make the      acquaintance of sir henry         i am sure that he would be delighted         then perhaps you would mention that i propose to do so  we may      in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him      until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings  will you      come upstairs  dr  watson  and inspect my collection of      lepidoptera  i think it is the most complete one in the      south west of england  by the time that you have looked through      them lunch will be almost ready        but i was eager to get back to my charge  the melancholy of the      moor  the death of the unfortunate pony  the weird sound which      had been associated with the grim legend of the baskervilles  all      these things tinged my thoughts with sadness  then on the top of      these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite      and distinct warning of miss stapleton  delivered with such      intense earnestness that i could not doubt that some grave and      deep reason lay behind it  i resisted all pressure to stay for      lunch  and i set off at once upon my return journey  taking the      grass grown path by which we had come       it seems  however  that there must have been some short cut for      those who knew it  for before i had reached the road i was      astounded to see miss stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side      of the track  her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions      and she held her hand to her side        i have run all the way in order to cut you off  dr  watson        said she   i had not even time to put on my hat  i must not stop       or my brother may miss me  i wanted to say to you how sorry i am      about the stupid mistake i made in thinking that you were sir      henry  please forget the words i said  which have no application      whatever to you         but i can t forget them  miss stapleton   said i   i am sir      henry s friend  and his welfare is a very close concern of mine       tell me why it was that you were so eager that sir henry should      return to london         a woman s whim  dr  watson  when you know me better you will      understand that i cannot always give reasons for what i say or      do         no  no  i remember the thrill in your voice  i remember the look      in your eyes  please  please  be frank with me  miss stapleton       for ever since i have been here i have been conscious of shadows      all round me  life has become like that great grimpen mire  with      little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with      no guide to point the track  tell me then what it was that you      meant  and i will promise to convey your warning to sir henry        an expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her      face  but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me        you make too much of it  dr  watson   said she   my brother and      i were very much shocked by the death of sir charles  we knew him      very intimately  for his favourite walk was over the moor to our      house  he was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the      family  and when this tragedy came i naturally felt that there      must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed  i was      distressed therefore when another member of the family came down      to live here  and i felt that he should be warned of the danger      which he will run  that was all which i intended to convey        but what is the danger         you know the story of the hound         i do not believe in such nonsense         but i do  if you have any influence with sir henry  take him      away from a place which has always been fatal to his family  the      world is wide  why should he wish to live at the place of      danger         because it  is  the place of danger  that is sir henry s nature       i fear that unless you can give me some more definite information      than this it would be impossible to get him to move         i cannot say anything definite  for i do not know anything      definite         i would ask you one more question  miss stapleton  if you meant      no more than this when you first spoke to me  why should you not      wish your brother to overhear what you said  there is nothing to      which he  or anyone else  could object         my brother is very anxious to have the hall inhabited  for he      thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor  he      would be very angry if he knew that i have said anything which      might induce sir henry to go away  but i have done my duty now      and i will say no more  i must go back  or he will miss me and      suspect that i have seen you  good bye   she turned and had      disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders  while      i  with my soul full of vague fears  pursued my way to      baskerville hall ',\n",
       " 'first report of dr  watson      from this point onward i will follow the course of events by      transcribing my own letters to mr  sherlock holmes which lie      before me on the table  one page is missing  but otherwise they      are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the      moment more accurately than my memory  clear as it is upon these      tragic events  can possibly do       baskerville hall  october   th       my dear holmes       my previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to      date as to all that has occurred in this most god forsaken corner      of the world  the longer one stays here the more does the spirit      of the moor sink into one s soul  its vastness  and also its grim      charm  when you are once out upon its bosom you have left all      traces of modern england behind you  but  on the other hand  you      are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the      prehistoric people  on all sides of you as you walk are the      houses of these forgotten folk  with their graves and the huge      monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples  as you      look at their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides you      leave your own age behind you  and if you were to see a      skin clad  hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a      flint tipped arrow on to the string of his bow  you would feel      that his presence there was more natural than your own  the      strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what      must always have been most unfruitful soil  i am no antiquarian       but i could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried      race who were forced to accept that which none other would      occupy       all this  however  is foreign to the mission on which you sent me      and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely      practical mind  i can still remember your complete indifference      as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round      the sun  let me  therefore  return to the facts concerning sir      henry baskerville       if you have not had any report within the last few days it is      because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate       then a very surprising circumstance occurred  which i shall tell      you in due course  but  first of all  i must keep you in touch      with some of the other factors in the situation       one of these  concerning which i have said little  is the escaped      convict upon the moor  there is strong reason now to believe that      he has got right away  which is a considerable relief to the      lonely householders of this district  a fortnight has passed      since his flight  during which he has not been seen and nothing      has been heard of him  it is surely inconceivable that he could      have held out upon the moor during all that time  of course  so      far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all  any      one of these stone huts would give him a hiding place  but there      is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of      the moor sheep  we think  therefore  that he has gone  and the      outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence       we are four able bodied men in this household  so that we could      take good care of ourselves  but i confess that i have had uneasy      moments when i have thought of the stapletons  they live miles      from any help  there are one maid  an old manservant  the sister       and the brother  the latter not a very strong man  they would be      helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this notting      hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance  both sir henry      and i were concerned at their situation  and it was suggested      that perkins the groom should go over to sleep there  but      stapleton would not hear of it       the fact is that our friend  the baronet  begins to display a      considerable interest in our fair neighbour  it is not to be      wondered at  for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an      active man like him  and she is a very fascinating and beautiful      woman  there is something tropical and exotic about her which      forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother       yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires  he has certainly a      very marked influence over her  for i have seen her continually      glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what      she said  i trust that he is kind to her  there is a dry glitter      in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips  which goes with a      positive and possibly a harsh nature  you would find him an      interesting study       he came over to call upon baskerville on that first day  and the      very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the      legend of the wicked hugo is supposed to have had its origin  it      was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which      is so dismal that it might have suggested the story  we found a      short valley between rugged tors which led to an open  grassy      space flecked over with the white cotton grass  in the middle of      it rose two great stones  worn and sharpened at the upper end      until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous      beast  in every way it corresponded with the scene of the old      tragedy  sir henry was much interested and asked stapleton more      than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the      interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men  he spoke      lightly  but it was evident that he was very much in earnest       stapleton was guarded in his replies  but it was easy to see that      he said less than he might  and that he would not express his      whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the      baronet  he told us of similar cases  where families had suffered      from some evil influence  and he left us with the impression that      he shared the popular view upon the matter       on our way back we stayed for lunch at merripit house  and it was      there that sir henry made the acquaintance of miss stapleton       from the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly      attracted by her  and i am much mistaken if the feeling was not      mutual  he referred to her again and again on our walk home  and      since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen      something of the brother and sister  they dine here tonight  and      there is some talk of our going to them next week  one would      imagine that such a match would be very welcome to stapleton  and      yet i have more than once caught a look of the strongest      disapprobation in his face when sir henry has been paying some      attention to his sister  he is much attached to her  no doubt       and would lead a lonely life without her  but it would seem the      height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her      making so brilliant a marriage  yet i am certain that he does not      wish their intimacy to ripen into love  and i have several times      observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being       t te   t te   by the way  your instructions to me never to allow      sir henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a      love affair were to be added to our other difficulties  my      popularity would soon suffer if i were to carry out your orders      to the letter       the other day thursday  to be more exact dr  mortimer lunched      with us  he has been excavating a barrow at long down and has got      a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy  never was      there such a single minded enthusiast as he  the stapletons came      in afterwards  and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley      at sir henry s request to show us exactly how everything occurred      upon that fatal night  it is a long  dismal walk  the yew alley       between two high walls of clipped hedge  with a narrow band of      grass upon either side  at the far end is an old tumble down      summer house  halfway down is the moor gate  where the old      gentleman left his cigar ash  it is a white wooden gate with a      latch  beyond it lies the wide moor  i remembered your theory of      the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred  as the old      man stood there he saw something coming across the moor       something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran      and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion  there was      the long  gloomy tunnel down which he fled  and from what  a      sheep dog of the moor  or a spectral hound  black  silent  and      monstrous  was there a human agency in the matter  did the pale       watchful barrymore know more than he cared to say  it was all dim      and vague  but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind      it       one other neighbour i have met since i wrote last  this is mr       frankland  of lafter hall  who lives some four miles to the south      of us  he is an elderly man  red faced  white haired  and      choleric  his passion is for the british law  and he has spent a      large fortune in litigation  he fights for the mere pleasure of      fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a      question  so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly      amusement  sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the      parish to make him open it  at others he will with his own hands      tear down some other man s gate and declare that a path has      existed there from time immemorial  defying the owner to      prosecute him for trespass  he is learned in old manorial and      communal rights  and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour      of the villagers of fernworthy and sometimes against them  so      that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the      village street or else burned in effigy  according to his latest      exploit  he is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands      at present  which will probably swallow up the remainder of his      fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the      future  apart from the law he seems a kindly  good natured      person  and i only mention him because you were particular that i      should send some description of the people who surround us  he is      curiously employed at present  for  being an amateur astronomer       he has an excellent telescope  with which he lies upon the roof      of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of      catching a glimpse of the escaped convict  if he would confine      his energies to this all would be well  but there are rumours      that he intends to prosecute dr  mortimer for opening a grave      without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the      neolithic skull in the barrow on long down  he helps to keep our      lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where      it is badly needed       and now  having brought you up to date in the escaped convict       the stapletons  dr  mortimer  and frankland  of lafter hall  let      me end on that which is most important and tell you more about      the barrymores  and especially about the surprising development      of last night       first of all about the test telegram  which you sent from london      in order to make sure that barrymore was really here  i have      already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that      the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the      other  i told sir henry how the matter stood  and he at once  in      his downright fashion  had barrymore up and asked him whether he      had received the telegram himself  barrymore said that he had        did the boy deliver it into your own hands   asked sir henry       barrymore looked surprised  and considered for a little time        no   said he   i was in the box room at the time  and my wife      brought it up to me         did you answer it yourself         no  i told my wife what to answer and she went down to write      it        in the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord        i could not quite understand the object of your questions this      morning  sir henry   said he   i trust that they do not mean that      i have done anything to forfeit your confidence        sir henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by      giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe  the london      outfit having now all arrived       mrs  barrymore is of interest to me  she is a heavy  solid      person  very limited  intensely respectable  and inclined to be      puritanical  you could hardly conceive a less emotional subject       yet i have told you how  on the first night here  i heard her      sobbing bitterly  and since then i have more than once observed      traces of tears upon her face  some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her      heart  sometimes i wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts      her  and sometimes i suspect barrymore of being a domestic      tyrant  i have always felt that there was something singular and      questionable in this man s character  but the adventure of last      night brings all my suspicions to a head       and yet it may seem a small matter in itself  you are aware that      i am not a very sound sleeper  and since i have been on guard in      this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever  last night       about two in the morning  i was aroused by a stealthy step      passing my room  i rose  opened my door  and peeped out  a long      black shadow was trailing down the corridor  it was thrown by a      man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his      hand  he was in shirt and trousers  with no covering to his feet       i could merely see the outline  but his height told me that it      was barrymore  he walked very slowly and circumspectly  and there      was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole      appearance       i have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which      runs round the hall  but that it is resumed upon the farther      side  i waited until he had passed out of sight and then i      followed him  when i came round the balcony he had reached the      end of the farther corridor  and i could see from the glimmer of      light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms       now  all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his      expedition became more mysterious than ever  the light shone      steadily as if he were standing motionless  i crept down the      passage as noiselessly as i could and peeped round the corner of      the door       barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held      against the glass  his profile was half turned towards me  and      his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out      into the blackness of the moor  for some minutes he stood      watching intently  then he gave a deep groan and with an      impatient gesture he put out the light  instantly i made my way      back to my room  and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing      once more upon their return journey  long afterwards when i had      fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock       but i could not tell whence the sound came  what it all means i      cannot guess  but there is some secret business going on in this      house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom      of  i do not trouble you with my theories  for you asked me to      furnish you only with facts  i have had a long talk with sir      henry this morning  and we have made a plan of campaign founded      upon my observations of last night  i will not speak about it      just now  but it should make my next report interesting reading ',\n",
       " 'the light upon the moor  second report of dr  watson       baskerville hall  oct    th       my dear holmes       if i was compelled to leave you without much news during the      early days of my mission you must acknowledge that i am making up      for lost time  and that events are now crowding thick and fast      upon us  in my last report i ended upon my top note with      barrymore at the window  and now i have quite a budget already      which will  unless i am much mistaken  considerably surprise you       things have taken a turn which i could not have anticipated  in      some ways they have within the last forty eight hours become much      clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated  but i      will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself       before breakfast on the morning following my adventure i went      down the corridor and examined the room in which barrymore had      been on the night before  the western window through which he had      stared so intently has  i noticed  one peculiarity above all      other windows in the house it commands the nearest outlook on to      the moor  there is an opening between two trees which enables one      from this point of view to look right down upon it  while from      all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be      obtained  it follows  therefore  that barrymore  since only this      window would serve the purpose  must have been looking out for      something or somebody upon the moor  the night was very dark  so      that i can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone       it had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was      on foot  that would have accounted for his stealthy movements and      also for the uneasiness of his wife  the man is a      striking looking fellow  very well equipped to steal the heart of      a country girl  so that this theory seemed to have something to      support it  that opening of the door which i had heard after i      had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep      some clandestine appointment  so i reasoned with myself in the      morning  and i tell you the direction of my suspicions  however      much the result may have shown that they were unfounded       but whatever the true explanation of barrymore s movements might      be  i felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself      until i could explain them was more than i could bear  i had an      interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast  and i      told him all that i had seen  he was less surprised than i had      expected        i knew that barrymore walked about nights  and i had a mind to      speak to him about it   said he   two or three times i have heard      his steps in the passage  coming and going  just about the hour      you name         perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular      window   i suggested        perhaps he does  if so  we should be able to shadow him and see      what it is that he is after  i wonder what your friend holmes      would do if he were here         i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest   said      i   he would follow barrymore and see what he did         then we shall do it together         but surely he would hear us         the man is rather deaf  and in any case we must take our chance      of that  we ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he      passes   sir henry rubbed his hands with pleasure  and it was      evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat      quiet life upon the moor       the baronet has been in communication with the architect who      prepared the plans for sir charles  and with a contractor from      london  so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon       there have been decorators and furnishers up from plymouth  and      it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare      no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family  when      the house is renovated and refurnished  all that he will need      will be a wife to make it complete  between ourselves there are      pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is      willing  for i have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a      woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour  miss stapleton       and yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as      one would under the circumstances expect  today  for example  its      surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple  which has caused      our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance       after the conversation which i have quoted about barrymore  sir      henry put on his hat and prepared to go out  as a matter of      course i did the same        what  are  you  coming  watson   he asked  looking at me in a      curious way        that depends on whether you are going on the moor   said i        yes  i am         well  you know what my instructions are  i am sorry to intrude       but you heard how earnestly holmes insisted that i should not      leave you  and especially that you should not go alone upon the      moor        sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile        my dear fellow   said he   holmes  with all his wisdom  did not      foresee some things which have happened since i have been on the      moor  you understand me  i am sure that you are the last man in      the world who would wish to be a spoil sport  i must go out      alone        it put me in a most awkward position  i was at a loss what to say      or what to do  and before i had made up my mind he picked up his      cane and was gone       but when i came to think the matter over my conscience reproached      me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my      sight  i imagined what my feelings would be if i had to return to      you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my      disregard for your instructions  i assure you my cheeks flushed      at the very thought  it might not even now be too late to      overtake him  so i set off at once in the direction of merripit      house       i hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing      anything of sir henry  until i came to the point where the moor      path branches off  there  fearing that perhaps i had come in the      wrong direction after all  i mounted a hill from which i could      command a view the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry       thence i saw him at once  he was on the moor path about a quarter      of a mile off  and a lady was by his side who could only be miss      stapleton  it was clear that there was already an understanding      between them and that they had met by appointment  they were      walking slowly along in deep conversation  and i saw her making      quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest      in what she was saying  while he listened intently  and once or      twice shook his head in strong dissent  i stood among the rocks      watching them  very much puzzled as to what i should do next  to      follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to      be an outrage  and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to      let him out of my sight  to act the spy upon a friend was a      hateful task  still  i could see no better course than to observe      him from the hill  and to clear my conscience by confessing to      him afterwards what i had done  it is true that if any sudden      danger had threatened him i was too far away to be of use  and      yet i am sure that you will agree with me that the position was      very difficult  and that there was nothing more which i could do       our friend  sir henry  and the lady had halted on the path and      were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation  when i was      suddenly aware that i was not the only witness of their      interview  a wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye  and      another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man      who was moving among the broken ground  it was stapleton with his      butterfly net  he was very much closer to the pair than i was       and he appeared to be moving in their direction  at this instant      sir henry suddenly drew miss stapleton to his side  his arm was      round her  but it seemed to me that she was straining away from      him with her face averted  he stooped his head to hers  and she      raised one hand as if in protest  next moment i saw them spring      apart and turn hurriedly round  stapleton was the cause of the      interruption  he was running wildly towards them  his absurd net      dangling behind him  he gesticulated and almost danced with      excitement in front of the lovers  what the scene meant i could      not imagine  but it seemed to me that stapleton was abusing sir      henry  who offered explanations  which became more angry as the      other refused to accept them  the lady stood by in haughty      silence  finally stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a      peremptory way to his sister  who  after an irresolute glance at      sir henry  walked off by the side of her brother  the      naturalist s angry gestures showed that the lady was included in      his displeasure  the baronet stood for a minute looking after      them  and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come       his head hanging  the very picture of dejection       what all this meant i could not imagine  but i was deeply ashamed      to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend s      knowledge  i ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at      the bottom  his face was flushed with anger and his brows were      wrinkled  like one who is at his wit s ends what to do        halloa  watson  where have you dropped from   said he   you      don t mean to say that you came after me in spite of all        i explained everything to him  how i had found it impossible to      remain behind  how i had followed him  and how i had witnessed      all that had occurred  for an instant his eyes blazed at me  but      my frankness disarmed his anger  and he broke at last into a      rather rueful laugh        you would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe      place for a man to be private   said he   but  by thunder  the      whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my      wooing and a mighty poor wooing at that  where had you engaged a      seat         i was on that hill         quite in the back row  eh  but her brother was well up to the      front  did you see him come out on us         yes  i did         did he ever strike you as being crazy this brother of hers         i can t say that he ever did         i dare say not  i always thought him sane enough until today       but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a      straitjacket  what s the matter with me  anyhow  you ve lived      near me for some weeks  watson  tell me straight  now  is there      anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a      woman that i loved         i should say not         he can t object to my worldly position  so it must be myself      that he has this down on  what has he against me  i never hurt      man or woman in my life that i know of  and yet he would not so      much as let me touch the tips of her fingers         did he say so         that  and a deal more  i tell you  watson  i ve only known her      these few weeks  but from the first i just felt that she was made      for me  and she  too she was happy when she was with me  and that      i ll swear  there s a light in a woman s eyes that speaks louder      than words  but he has never let us get together and it was only      today for the first time that i saw a chance of having a few      words with her alone  she was glad to meet me  but when she did      it was not love that she would talk about  and she wouldn t have      let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it  she      kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger  and that      she would never be happy until i had left it  i told her that      since i had seen her i was in no hurry to leave it  and that if      she really wanted me to go  the only way to work it was for her      to arrange to go with me  with that i offered in as many words to      marry her  but before she could answer  down came this brother of      hers  running at us with a face on him like a madman  he was just      white with rage  and those light eyes of his were blazing with      fury  what was i doing with the lady  how dared i offer her      attentions which were distasteful to her  did i think that      because i was a baronet i could do what i liked  if he had not      been her brother i should have known better how to answer him  as      it was i told him that my feelings towards his sister were such      as i was not ashamed of  and that i hoped that she might honour      me by becoming my wife  that seemed to make the matter no better       so then i lost my temper too  and i answered him rather more      hotly than i should perhaps  considering that she was standing      by  so it ended by his going off with her  as you saw  and here      am i as badly puzzled a man as any in this county  just tell me      what it all means  watson  and i ll owe you more than ever i can      hope to pay        i tried one or two explanations  but  indeed  i was completely      puzzled myself  our friend s title  his fortune  his age  his      character  and his appearance are all in his favour  and i know      nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his      family  that his advances should be rejected so brusquely without      any reference to the lady s own wishes and that the lady should      accept the situation without protest is very amazing  however       our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from stapleton      himself that very afternoon  he had come to offer apologies for      his rudeness of the morning  and after a long private interview      with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was      that the breach is quite healed  and that we are to dine at      merripit house next friday as a sign of it        i don t say now that he isn t a crazy man   said sir henry   i      can t forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning       but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology      than he has done         did he give any explanation of his conduct         his sister is everything in his life  he says  that is natural      enough  and i am glad that he should understand her value  they      have always been together  and according to his account he has      been a very lonely man with only her as a companion  so that the      thought of losing her was really terrible to him  he had not      understood  he said  that i was becoming attached to her  but      when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so  and that she      might be taken away from him  it gave him such a shock that for a      time he was not responsible for what he said or did  he was very      sorry for all that had passed  and he recognized how foolish and      how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a      beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life  if      she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like      myself than to anyone else  but in any case it was a blow to him      and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself      to meet it  he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i      would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be      content with cultivating the lady s friendship during that time      without claiming her love  this i promised  and so the matter      rests        so there is one of our small mysteries cleared up  it is      something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we      are floundering  we know now why stapleton looked with disfavour      upon his sister s suitor even when that suitor was so eligible a      one as sir henry  and now i pass on to another thread which i      have extricated out of the tangled skein  the mystery of the sobs      in the night  of the tear stained face of mrs  barrymore  of the      secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window       congratulate me  my dear holmes  and tell me that i have not      disappointed you as an agent that you do not regret the      confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down  all      these things have by one night s work been thoroughly cleared       i have said  by one night s work   but  in truth  it was by two      nights  work  for on the first we drew entirely blank  i sat up      with sir henry in his rooms until nearly three o clock in the      morning  but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming      clock upon the stairs  it was a most melancholy vigil and ended      by each of us falling asleep in our chairs  fortunately we were      not discouraged  and we determined to try again  the next night      we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the      least sound  it was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by       and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient      interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into      which he hopes the game may wander  one struck  and two  and we      had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an      instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary      senses keenly on the alert once more  we had heard the creak of a      step in the passage       very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the      distance  then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out      in pursuit  already our man had gone round the gallery and the      corridor was all in darkness  softly we stole along until we had      come into the other wing  we were just in time to catch a glimpse      of the tall  black bearded figure  his shoulders rounded as he      tiptoed down the passage  then he passed through the same door as      before  and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and      shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor  we      shuffled cautiously towards it  trying every plank before we      dared to put our whole weight upon it  we had taken the      precaution of leaving our boots behind us  but  even so  the old      boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread  sometimes it seemed      impossible that he should fail to hear our approach  however  the      man is fortunately rather deaf  and he was entirely preoccupied      in that which he was doing  when at last we reached the door and      peeped through we found him crouching at the window  candle in      hand  his white  intent face pressed against the pane  exactly as      i had seen him two nights before       we had arranged no plan of campaign  but the baronet is a man to      whom the most direct way is always the most natural  he walked      into the room  and as he did so barrymore sprang up from the      window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood  livid and      trembling  before us  his dark eyes  glaring out of the white      mask of his face  were full of horror and astonishment as he      gazed from sir henry to me        what are you doing here  barrymore         nothing  sir   his agitation was so great that he could hardly      speak  and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his      candle   it was the window  sir  i go round at night to see that      they are fastened         on the second floor         yes  sir  all the windows         look here  barrymore   said sir henry sternly   we have made up      our minds to have the truth out of you  so it will save you      trouble to tell it sooner rather than later  come  now  no lies       what were you doing at that window        the fellow looked at us in a helpless way  and he wrung his hands      together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and      misery        i was doing no harm  sir  i was holding a candle to the window         and why were you holding a candle to the window         don t ask me  sir henry don t ask me  i give you my word  sir       that it is not my secret  and that i cannot tell it  if it      concerned no one but myself i would not try to keep it from you        a sudden idea occurred to me  and i took the candle from the      trembling hand of the butler        he must have been holding it as a signal   said i   let us see      if there is any answer   i held it as he had done  and stared out      into the darkness of the night  vaguely i could discern the black      bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor  for the      moon was behind the clouds  and then i gave a cry of exultation       for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the      dark veil  and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square      framed by the window        there it is   i cried        no  no  sir  it is nothing nothing at all   the butler broke in        i assure you  sir         move your light across the window  watson   cried the baronet        see  the other moves also  now  you rascal  do you deny that it      is a signal  come  speak up  who is your confederate out yonder       and what is this conspiracy that is going on        the man s face became openly defiant   it is my business  and not      yours  i will not tell         then you leave my employment right away         very good  sir  if i must i must         and you go in disgrace  by thunder  you may well be ashamed of      yourself  your family has lived with mine for over a hundred      years under this roof  and here i find you deep in some dark plot      against me         no  no  sir  no  not against you   it was a woman s voice  and      mrs  barrymore  paler and more horror struck than her husband       was standing at the door  her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt      might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling      upon her face        we have to go  eliza  this is the end of it  you can pack our      things   said the butler        oh  john  john  have i brought you to this  it is my doing  sir      henry all mine  he has done nothing except for my sake and      because i asked him         speak out  then  what does it mean         my unhappy brother is starving on the moor  we cannot let him      perish at our very gates  the light is a signal to him that food      is ready for him  and his light out yonder is to show the spot to      which to bring it         then your brother is         the escaped convict  sir selden  the criminal         that s the truth  sir   said barrymore   i said that it was not      my secret and that i could not tell it to you  but now you have      heard it  and you will see that if there was a plot it was not      against you        this  then  was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at      night and the light at the window  sir henry and i both stared at      the woman in amazement  was it possible that this stolidly      respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most      notorious criminals in the country        yes  sir  my name was selden  and he is my younger brother  we      humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way      in everything until he came to think that the world was made for      his pleasure  and that he could do what he liked in it  then as      he grew older he met wicked companions  and the devil entered      into him until he broke my mother s heart and dragged our name in      the dirt  from crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is      only the mercy of god which has snatched him from the scaffold       but to me  sir  he was always the little curly headed boy that i      had nursed and played with as an elder sister would  that was why      he broke prison  sir  he knew that i was here and that we could      not refuse to help him  when he dragged himself here one night       weary and starving  with the warders hard at his heels  what      could we do  we took him in and fed him and cared for him  then      you returned  sir  and my brother thought he would be safer on      the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over  so he      lay in hiding there  but every second night we made sure if he      was still there by putting a light in the window  and if there      was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him       every day we hoped that he was gone  but as long as he was there      we could not desert him  that is the whole truth  as i am an      honest christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in      the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me  for whose      sake he has done all that he has        the woman s words came with an intense earnestness which carried      conviction with them        is this true  barrymore         yes  sir henry  every word of it         well  i cannot blame you for standing by your own wife  forget      what i have said  go to your room  you two  and we shall talk      further about this matter in the morning        when they were gone we looked out of the window again  sir henry      had flung it open  and the cold night wind beat in upon our      faces  far away in the black distance there still glowed that one      tiny point of yellow light        i wonder he dares   said sir henry        it may be so placed as to be only visible from here         very likely  how far do you think it is         out by the cleft tor  i think         not more than a mile or two off         hardly that         well  it cannot be far if barrymore had to carry out the food to      it  and he is waiting  this villain  beside that candle  by      thunder  watson  i am going out to take that man        the same thought had crossed my own mind  it was not as if the      barrymores had taken us into their confidence  their secret had      been forced from them  the man was a danger to the community  an      unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse       we were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him      back where he could do no harm  with his brutal and violent      nature  others would have to pay the price if we held our hands       any night  for example  our neighbours the stapletons might be      attacked by him  and it may have been the thought of this which      made sir henry so keen upon the adventure        i will come   said i        then get your revolver and put on your boots  the sooner we      start the better  as the fellow may put out his light and be      off        in five minutes we were outside the door  starting upon our      expedition  we hurried through the dark shrubbery  amid the dull      moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves       the night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay  now and      again the moon peeped out for an instant  but clouds were driving      over the face of the sky  and just as we came out on the moor a      thin rain began to fall  the light still burned steadily in      front        are you armed   i asked        i have a hunting crop         we must close in on him rapidly  for he is said to be a      desperate fellow  we shall take him by surprise and have him at      our mercy before he can resist         i say  watson   said the baronet   what would holmes say to      this  how about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil      is exalted        as if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast      gloom of the moor that strange cry which i had already heard upon      the borders of the great grimpen mire  it came with the wind      through the silence of the night  a long  deep mutter  then a      rising howl  and then the sad moan in which it died away  again      and again it sounded  the whole air throbbing with it  strident       wild  and menacing  the baronet caught my sleeve and his face      glimmered white through the darkness        my god  what s that  watson         i don t know  it s a sound they have on the moor  i heard it      once before        it died away  and an absolute silence closed in upon us  we stood      straining our ears  but nothing came        watson   said the baronet   it was the cry of a hound        my blood ran cold in my veins  for there was a break in his voice      which told of the sudden horror which had seized him        what do they call this sound   he asked        who         the folk on the countryside         oh  they are ignorant people  why should you mind what they call      it         tell me  watson  what do they say of it        i hesitated but could not escape the question        they say it is the cry of the hound of the baskervilles        he groaned and was silent for a few moments        a hound it was   he said at last   but it seemed to come from      miles away  over yonder  i think         it was hard to say whence it came         it rose and fell with the wind  isn t that the direction of the      great grimpen mire         yes  it is         well  it was up there  come now  watson  didn t you think      yourself that it was the cry of a hound  i am not a child  you      need not fear to speak the truth         stapleton was with me when i heard it last  he said that it      might be the calling of a strange bird         no  no  it was a hound  my god  can there be some truth in all      these stories  is it possible that i am really in danger from so      dark a cause  you don t believe it  do you  watson         no  no         and yet it was one thing to laugh about it in london  and it is      another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear      such a cry as that  and my uncle  there was the footprint of the      hound beside him as he lay  it all fits together  i don t think      that i am a coward  watson  but that sound seemed to freeze my      very blood  feel my hand        it was as cold as a block of marble        you ll be all right tomorrow         i don t think i ll get that cry out of my head  what do you      advise that we do now         shall we turn back         no  by thunder  we have come out to get our man  and we will do      it  we after the convict  and a hell hound  as likely as not       after us  come on  we ll see it through if all the fiends of the      pit were loose upon the moor        we stumbled slowly along in the darkness  with the black loom of      the craggy hills around us  and the yellow speck of light burning      steadily in front  there is nothing so deceptive as the distance      of a light upon a pitch dark night  and sometimes the glimmer      seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might      have been within a few yards of us  but at last we could see      whence it came  and then we knew that we were indeed very close       a guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which      flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also      to prevent it from being visible  save in the direction of      baskerville hall  a boulder of granite concealed our approach       and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light  it      was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle      of the moor  with no sign of life near it just the one straight      yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it        what shall we do now   whispered sir henry        wait here  he must be near his light  let us see if we can get a      glimpse of him        the words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him  over      the rocks  in the crevice of which the candle burned  there was      thrust out an evil yellow face  a terrible animal face  all      seamed and scored with vile passions  foul with mire  with a      bristling beard  and hung with matted hair  it might well have      belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on      the hillsides  the light beneath him was reflected in his small       cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the      darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps      of the hunters       something had evidently aroused his suspicions  it may have been      that barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to      give  or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking      that all was not well  but i could read his fears upon his wicked      face  any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the      darkness  i sprang forward therefore  and sir henry did the same       at the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and      hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had      sheltered us  i caught one glimpse of his short  squat  strongly      built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run  at the      same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds       we rushed over the brow of the hill  and there was our man      running with great speed down the other side  springing over the      stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat  a lucky      long shot of my revolver might have crippled him  but i had      brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an      unarmed man who was running away       we were both swift runners and in fairly good training  but we      soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him  we saw him      for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck      moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant      hill  we ran and ran until we were completely blown  but the      space between us grew ever wider  finally we stopped and sat      panting on two rocks  while we watched him disappearing in the      distance       and it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and      unexpected thing  we had risen from our rocks and were turning to      go home  having abandoned the hopeless chase  the moon was low      upon the right  and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up      against the lower curve of its silver disc  there  outlined as      black as an ebony statue on that shining background  i saw the      figure of a man upon the tor  do not think that it was a      delusion  holmes  i assure you that i have never in my life seen      anything more clearly  as far as i could judge  the figure was      that of a tall  thin man  he stood with his legs a little      separated  his arms folded  his head bowed  as if he were      brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which      lay before him  he might have been the very spirit of that      terrible place  it was not the convict  this man was far from the      place where the latter had disappeared  besides  he was a much      taller man  with a cry of surprise i pointed him out to the      baronet  but in the instant during which i had turned to grasp      his arm the man was gone  there was the sharp pinnacle of granite      still cutting the lower edge of the moon  but its peak bore no      trace of that silent and motionless figure       i wished to go in that direction and to search the tor  but it      was some distance away  the baronet s nerves were still quivering      from that cry  which recalled the dark story of his family  and      he was not in the mood for fresh adventures  he had not seen this      lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his      strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me   a      warder  no doubt   said he   the moor has been thick with them      since this fellow escaped   well  perhaps his explanation may be      the right one  but i should like to have some further proof of      it  today we mean to communicate to the princetown people where      they should look for their missing man  but it is hard lines that      we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our      own prisoner  such are the adventures of last night  and you must      acknowledge  my dear holmes  that i have done you very well in      the matter of a report  much of what i tell you is no doubt quite      irrelevant  but still i feel that it is best that i should let      you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those      which will be of most service to you in helping you to your      conclusions  we are certainly making some progress  so far as the      barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions  and that      has cleared up the situation very much  but the moor with its      mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as      ever  perhaps in my next i may be able to throw some light upon      this also  best of all would it be if you could come down to us       in any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next      few days ',\n",
       " 'extract from the diary of dr  watson      so far i have been able to quote from the reports which i have      forwarded during these early days to sherlock holmes  now       however  i have arrived at a point in my narrative where i am      compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my      recollections  aided by the diary which i kept at the time  a few      extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which      are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory  i proceed       then  from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the      convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor        october     th   a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain       the house is banked in with rolling clouds  which rise now and      then to show the dreary curves of the moor  with thin  silver      veins upon the sides of the hills  and the distant boulders      gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces  it is      melancholy outside and in  the baronet is in a black reaction      after the excitements of the night  i am conscious myself of a      weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger ever present      danger  which is the more terrible because i am unable to define      it       and have i not cause for such a feeling  consider the long      sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister      influence which is at work around us  there is the death of the      last occupant of the hall  fulfilling so exactly the conditions      of the family legend  and there are the repeated reports from      peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor       twice i have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the      distant baying of a hound  it is incredible  impossible  that it      should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature  a spectral      hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its      howling is surely not to be thought of  stapleton may fall in      with such a superstition  and mortimer also  but if i have one      quality upon earth it is common sense  and nothing will persuade      me to believe in such a thing  to do so would be to descend to      the level of these poor peasants  who are not content with a mere      fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell fire shooting      from his mouth and eyes  holmes would not listen to such fancies       and i am his agent  but facts are facts  and i have twice heard      this crying upon the moor  suppose that there were really some      huge hound loose upon it  that would go far to explain      everything  but where could such a hound lie concealed  where did      it get its food  where did it come from  how was it that no one      saw it by day  it must be confessed that the natural explanation      offers almost as many difficulties as the other  and always       apart from the hound  there is the fact of the human agency in      london  the man in the cab  and the letter which warned sir henry      against the moor  this at least was real  but it might have been      the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy  where      is that friend or enemy now  has he remained in london  or has he      followed us down here  could he could he be the stranger whom i      saw upon the tor       it is true that i have had only the one glance at him  and yet      there are some things to which i am ready to swear  he is no one      whom i have seen down here  and i have now met all the      neighbours  the figure was far taller than that of stapleton  far      thinner than that of frankland  barrymore it might possibly have      been  but we had left him behind us  and i am certain that he      could not have followed us  a stranger then is still dogging us       just as a stranger dogged us in london  we have never shaken him      off  if i could lay my hands upon that man  then at last we might      find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties  to this one      purpose i must now devote all my energies       my first impulse was to tell sir henry all my plans  my second      and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as      possible to anyone  he is silent and distrait  his nerves have      been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor  i will say      nothing to add to his anxieties  but i will take my own steps to      attain my own end       we had a small scene this morning after breakfast  barrymore      asked leave to speak with sir henry  and they were closeted in      his study some little time  sitting in the billiard room i more      than once heard the sound of voices raised  and i had a pretty      good idea what the point was which was under discussion  after a      time the baronet opened his door and called for me   barrymore      considers that he has a grievance   he said   he thinks that it      was unfair on our part to hunt his brother in law down when he       of his own free will  had told us the secret        the butler was standing very pale but very collected before us        i may have spoken too warmly  sir   said he   and if i have  i      am sure that i beg your pardon  at the same time  i was very much      surprised when i heard you two gentlemen come back this morning      and learned that you had been chasing selden  the poor fellow has      enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track         if you had told us of your own free will it would have been a      different thing   said the baronet   you only told us  or rather      your wife only told us  when it was forced from you and you could      not help yourself         i didn t think you would have taken advantage of it  sir      henry indeed i didn t         the man is a public danger  there are lonely houses scattered      over the moor  and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing  you      only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that  look at mr       stapleton s house  for example  with no one but himself to defend      it  there s no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key         he ll break into no house  sir  i give you my solemn word upon      that  but he will never trouble anyone in this country again  i      assure you  sir henry  that in a very few days the necessary      arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to      south america  for god s sake  sir  i beg of you not to let the      police know that he is still on the moor  they have given up the      chase there  and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for      him  you can t tell on him without getting my wife and me into      trouble  i beg you  sir  to say nothing to the police         what do you say  watson        i shrugged my shoulders   if he were safely out of the country it      would relieve the tax payer of a burden         but how about the chance of his holding someone up before he      goes         he would not do anything so mad  sir  we have provided him with      all that he can want  to commit a crime would be to show where he      was hiding         that is true   said sir henry   well  barrymore         god bless you  sir  and thank you from my heart  it would have      killed my poor wife had he been taken again         i guess we are aiding and abetting a felony  watson  but  after      what we have heard i don t feel as if i could give the man up  so      there is an end of it  all right  barrymore  you can go        with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned  but he      hesitated and then came back        you ve been so kind to us  sir  that i should like to do the      best i can for you in return  i know something  sir henry  and      perhaps i should have said it before  but it was long after the      inquest that i found it out  i ve never breathed a word about it      yet to mortal man  it s about poor sir charles s death        the baronet and i were both upon our feet   do you know how he      died         no  sir  i don t know that         what then         i know why he was at the gate at that hour  it was to meet a      woman         to meet a woman  he         yes  sir         and the woman s name         i can t give you the name  sir  but i can give you the initials       her initials were l  l         how do you know this  barrymore         well  sir henry  your uncle had a letter that morning  he had      usually a great many letters  for he was a public man and well      known for his kind heart  so that everyone who was in trouble was      glad to turn to him  but that morning  as it chanced  there was      only this one letter  so i took the more notice of it  it was      from coombe tracey  and it was addressed in a woman s hand         well         well  sir  i thought no more of the matter  and never would have      done had it not been for my wife  only a few weeks ago she was      cleaning out sir charles s study it had never been touched since      his death and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back      of the grate  the greater part of it was charred to pieces  but      one little slip  the end of a page  hung together  and the      writing could still be read  though it was grey on a black      ground  it seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the      letter and it said   please  please  as you are a gentleman  burn      this letter  and be at the gate by ten o clock  beneath it were      signed the initials l  l         have you got that slip         no  sir  it crumbled all to bits after we moved it         had sir charles received any other letters in the same writing         well  sir  i took no particular notice of his letters  i should      not have noticed this one  only it happened to come alone         and you have no idea who l  l  is         no  sir  no more than you have  but i expect if we could lay our      hands upon that lady we should know more about sir charles s      death         i cannot understand  barrymore  how you came to conceal this      important information         well  sir  it was immediately after that our own trouble came to      us  and then again  sir  we were both of us very fond of sir      charles  as we well might be considering all that he has done for      us  to rake this up couldn t help our poor master  and it s well      to go carefully when there s a lady in the case  even the best of      us         you thought it might injure his reputation         well  sir  i thought no good could come of it  but now you have      been kind to us  and i feel as if it would be treating you      unfairly not to tell you all that i know about the matter         very good  barrymore  you can go   when the butler had left us      sir henry turned to me   well  watson  what do you think of this      new light         it seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before         so i think  but if we can only trace l  l  it should clear up      the whole business  we have gained that much  we know that there      is someone who has the facts if we can only find her  what do you      think we should do         let holmes know all about it at once  it will give him the clue      for which he has been seeking  i am much mistaken if it does not      bring him down        i went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning s      conversation for holmes  it was evident to me that he had been      very busy of late  for the notes which i had from baker street      were few and short  with no comments upon the information which i      had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission  no doubt his      blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties  and yet this      new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his      interest  i wish that he were here        october     th   all day today the rain poured down  rustling on      the ivy and dripping from the eaves  i thought of the convict out      upon the bleak  cold  shelterless moor  poor devil  whatever his      crimes  he has suffered something to atone for them  and then i      thought of that other one the face in the cab  the figure against      the moon  was he also out in that deluged the unseen watcher  the      man of darkness  in the evening i put on my waterproof and i      walked far upon the sodden moor  full of dark imaginings  the      rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears       god help those who wander into the great mire now  for even the      firm uplands are becoming a morass  i found the black tor upon      which i had seen the solitary watcher  and from its craggy summit      i looked out myself across the melancholy downs  rain squalls      drifted across their russet face  and the heavy  slate coloured      clouds hung low over the landscape  trailing in grey wreaths down      the sides of the fantastic hills  in the distant hollow on the      left  half hidden by the mist  the two thin towers of baskerville      hall rose above the trees  they were the only signs of human life      which i could see  save only those prehistoric huts which lay      thickly upon the slopes of the hills  nowhere was there any trace      of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot two nights      before       as i walked back i was overtaken by dr  mortimer driving in his      dog cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying      farmhouse of foulmire  he has been very attentive to us  and      hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see      how we were getting on  he insisted upon my climbing into his      dog cart  and he gave me a lift homeward  i found him much      troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel  it had      wandered on to the moor and had never come back  i gave him such      consolation as i might  but i thought of the pony on the grimpen      mire  and i do not fancy that he will see his little dog again        by the way  mortimer   said i as we jolted along the rough road        i suppose there are few people living within driving distance of      this whom you do not know         hardly any  i think         can you  then  tell me the name of any woman whose initials are      l  l         he thought for a few minutes        no   said he   there are a few gipsies and labouring folk for      whom i can t answer  but among the farmers or gentry there is no      one whose initials are those  wait a bit though   he added after      a pause   there is laura lyons her initials are l  l  but she      lives in coombe tracey         who is she   i asked        she is frankland s daughter         what  old frankland the crank         exactly  she married an artist named lyons  who came sketching      on the moor  he proved to be a blackguard and deserted her  the      fault from what i hear may not have been entirely on one side       her father refused to have anything to do with her because she      had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other      reasons as well  so  between the old sinner and the young one the      girl has had a pretty bad time         how does she live         i fancy old frankland allows her a pittance  but it cannot be      more  for his own affairs are considerably involved  whatever she      may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the      bad  her story got about  and several of the people here did      something to enable her to earn an honest living  stapleton did      for one  and sir charles for another  i gave a trifle myself  it      was to set her up in a typewriting business        he wanted to know the object of my inquiries  but i managed to      satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much  for there is      no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence  tomorrow      morning i shall find my way to coombe tracey  and if i can see      this mrs  laura lyons  of equivocal reputation  a long step will      have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of      mysteries  i am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent       for when mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent      i asked him casually to what type frankland s skull belonged  and      so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive  i have      not lived for years with sherlock holmes for nothing       i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous      and melancholy day  this was my conversation with barrymore just      now  which gives me one more strong card which i can play in due      time       mortimer had stayed to dinner  and he and the baronet played       cart  afterwards  the butler brought me my coffee into the      library  and i took the chance to ask him a few questions        well   said i   has this precious relation of yours departed  or      is he still lurking out yonder         i don t know  sir  i hope to heaven that he has gone  for he has      brought nothing but trouble here  i ve not heard of him since i      left out food for him last  and that was three days ago         did you see him then         no  sir  but the food was gone when next i went that way         then he was certainly there         so you would think  sir  unless it was the other man who took      it        i sat with my coffee cup halfway to my lips and stared at      barrymore        you know that there is another man then         yes  sir  there is another man upon the moor         have you seen him         no  sir         how do you know of him then         selden told me of him  sir  a week ago or more  he s in hiding       too  but he s not a convict as far as i can make out  i don t      like it  dr  watson i tell you straight  sir  that i don t like      it   he spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness        now  listen to me  barrymore  i have no interest in this matter      but that of your master  i have come here with no object except      to help him  tell me  frankly  what it is that you don t like        barrymore hesitated for a moment  as if he regretted his outburst      or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words        it s all these goings on  sir   he cried at last  waving his      hand towards the rain lashed window which faced the moor        there s foul play somewhere  and there s black villainy brewing       to that i ll swear  very glad i should be  sir  to see sir henry      on his way back to london again         but what is it that alarms you         look at sir charles s death  that was bad enough  for all that      the coroner said  look at the noises on the moor at night       there s not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for      it  look at this stranger hiding out yonder  and watching and      waiting  what s he waiting for  what does it mean  it means no      good to anyone of the name of baskerville  and very glad i shall      be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henry s new servants      are ready to take over the hall         but about this stranger   said i   can you tell me anything      about him  what did selden say  did he find out where he hid  or      what he was doing         he saw him once or twice  but he is a deep one and gives nothing      away  at first he thought that he was the police  but soon he      found that he had some lay of his own  a kind of gentleman he      was  as far as he could see  but what he was doing he could not      make out         and where did he say that he lived         among the old houses on the hillside the stone huts where the      old folk used to live         but how about his food         selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and      brings all he needs  i dare say he goes to coombe tracey for what      he wants         very good  barrymore  we may talk further of this some other      time   when the butler had gone i walked over to the black      window  and i looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds      and at the tossing outline of the wind swept trees  it is a wild      night indoors  and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor       what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in      such a place at such a time  and what deep and earnest purpose      can he have which calls for such a trial  there  in that hut upon      the moor  seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has      vexed me so sorely  i swear that another day shall not have      passed before i have done all that man can do to reach the heart      of the mystery ',\n",
       " 'the man on the tor      the extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter      has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of october  a time      when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their      terrible conclusion  the incidents of the next few days are      indelibly graven upon my recollection  and i can tell them      without reference to the notes made at the time  i start them      from the day which succeeded that upon which i had established      two facts of great importance  the one that mrs  laura lyons of      coombe tracey had written to sir charles baskerville and made an      appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his      death  the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be      found among the stone huts upon the hillside  with these two      facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my      courage must be deficient if i could not throw some further light      upon these dark places       i had no opportunity to tell the baronet what i had learned about      mrs  lyons upon the evening before  for dr  mortimer remained      with him at cards until it was very late  at breakfast  however       i informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would      care to accompany me to coombe tracey  at first he was very eager      to come  but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i      went alone the results might be better  the more formal we made      the visit the less information we might obtain  i left sir henry      behind  therefore  not without some prickings of conscience  and      drove off upon my new quest       when i reached coombe tracey i told perkins to put up the horses       and i made inquiries for the lady whom i had come to interrogate       i had no difficulty in finding her rooms  which were central and      well appointed  a maid showed me in without ceremony  and as i      entered the sitting room a lady  who was sitting before a      remington typewriter  sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome       her face fell  however  when she saw that i was a stranger  and      she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit       the first impression left by mrs  lyons was one of extreme      beauty  her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour  and      her cheeks  though considerably freckled  were flushed with the      exquisite bloom of the brunette  the dainty pink which lurks at      the heart of the sulphur rose  admiration was  i repeat  the      first impression  but the second was criticism  there was      something subtly wrong with the face  some coarseness of      expression  some hardness  perhaps  of eye  some looseness of lip      which marred its perfect beauty  but these  of course  are      afterthoughts  at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in      the presence of a very handsome woman  and that she was asking me      the reasons for my visit  i had not quite understood until that      instant how delicate my mission was        i have the pleasure   said i   of knowing your father        it was a clumsy introduction  and the lady made me feel it        there is nothing in common between my father and me   she said        i owe him nothing  and his friends are not mine  if it were not      for the late sir charles baskerville and some other kind hearts i      might have starved for all that my father cared         it was about the late sir charles baskerville that i have come      here to see you        the freckles started out on the lady s face        what can i tell you about him   she asked  and her fingers      played nervously over the stops of her typewriter        you knew him  did you not         i have already said that i owe a great deal to his kindness  if      i am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest      which he took in my unhappy situation         did you correspond with him        the lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes        what is the object of these questions   she asked sharply        the object is to avoid a public scandal  it is better that i      should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our      control        she was silent and her face was still very pale  at last she      looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner        well  i ll answer   she said   what are your questions         did you correspond with sir charles         i certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his      delicacy and his generosity         have you the dates of those letters         no         have you ever met him         yes  once or twice  when he came into coombe tracey  he was a      very retiring man  and he preferred to do good by stealth         but if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom  how did he      know enough about your affairs to be able to help you  as you say      that he has done        she met my difficulty with the utmost readiness        there were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united      to help me  one was mr  stapleton  a neighbour and intimate      friend of sir charles s  he was exceedingly kind  and it was      through him that sir charles learned about my affairs        i knew already that sir charles baskerville had made stapleton      his almoner upon several occasions  so the lady s statement bore      the impress of truth upon it        did you ever write to sir charles asking him to meet you   i      continued       mrs  lyons flushed with anger again   really  sir  this is a very      extraordinary question         i am sorry  madam  but i must repeat it         then i answer  certainly not         not on the very day of sir charles s death        the flush had faded in an instant  and a deathly face was before      me  her dry lips could not speak the  no  which i saw rather than      heard        surely your memory deceives you   said i   i could even quote a      passage of your letter  it ran  please  please  as you are a      gentleman  burn this letter  and be at the gate by ten o clock         i thought that she had fainted  but she recovered herself by a      supreme effort        is there no such thing as a gentleman   she gasped        you do sir charles an injustice  he  did  burn the letter  but      sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned  you      acknowledge now that you wrote it         yes  i did write it   she cried  pouring out her soul in a      torrent of words   i did write it  why should i deny it  i have      no reason to be ashamed of it  i wished him to help me  i      believed that if i had an interview i could gain his help  so i      asked him to meet me         but why at such an hour         because i had only just learned that he was going to london next      day and might be away for months  there were reasons why i could      not get there earlier         but why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the      house         do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor s      house         well  what happened when you did get there         i never went         mrs  lyons         no  i swear it to you on all i hold sacred  i never went       something intervened to prevent my going         what was that         that is a private matter  i cannot tell it         you acknowledge then that you made an appointment with sir      charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death  but      you deny that you kept the appointment         that is the truth        again and again i cross questioned her  but i could never get      past that point        mrs  lyons   said i as i rose from this long and inconclusive      interview   you are taking a very great responsibility and      putting yourself in a very false position by not making an      absolutely clean breast of all that you know  if i have to call      in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are      compromised  if your position is innocent  why did you in the      first instance deny having written to sir charles upon that      date         because i feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from      it and that i might find myself involved in a scandal         and why were you so pressing that sir charles should destroy      your letter         if you have read the letter you will know         i did not say that i had read all the letter         you quoted some of it         i quoted the postscript  the letter had  as i said  been burned      and it was not all legible  i ask you once again why it was that      you were so pressing that sir charles should destroy this letter      which he received on the day of his death         the matter is a very private one         the more reason why you should avoid a public investigation         i will tell you  then  if you have heard anything of my unhappy      history you will know that i made a rash marriage and had reason      to regret it         i have heard so much         my life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom i      abhor  the law is upon his side  and every day i am faced by the      possibility that he may force me to live with him  at the time      that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there      was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses      could be met  it meant everything to me peace of mind  happiness       self respect everything  i knew sir charles s generosity  and i      thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help      me         then how is it that you did not go         because i received help in the interval from another source         why then  did you not write to sir charles and explain this         so i should have done had i not seen his death in the paper next      morning        the woman s story hung coherently together  and all my questions      were unable to shake it  i could only check it by finding if she      had  indeed  instituted divorce proceedings against her husband      at or about the time of the tragedy       it was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been      to baskerville hall if she really had been  for a trap would be      necessary to take her there  and could not have returned to      coombe tracey until the early hours of the morning  such an      excursion could not be kept secret  the probability was       therefore  that she was telling the truth  or  at least  a part      of the truth  i came away baffled and disheartened  once again i      had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every      path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission  and yet      the more i thought of the lady s face and of her manner the more      i felt that something was being held back from me  why should she      turn so pale  why should she fight against every admission until      it was forced from her  why should she have been so reticent at      the time of the tragedy  surely the explanation of all this could      not be as innocent as she would have me believe  for the moment i      could proceed no farther in that direction  but must turn back to      that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts      upon the moor       and that was a most vague direction  i realised it as i drove      back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient      people  barrymore s only indication had been that the stranger      lived in one of these abandoned huts  and many hundreds of them      are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor  but      i had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man      himself standing upon the summit of the black tor  that  then       should be the centre of my search  from there i should explore      every hut upon the moor until i lighted upon the right one  if      this man were inside it i should find out from his own lips  at      the point of my revolver if necessary  who he was and why he had      dogged us so long  he might slip away from us in the crowd of      regent street  but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely      moor  on the other hand  if i should find the hut and its tenant      should not be within it i must remain there  however long the      vigil  until he returned  holmes had missed him in london  it      would indeed be a triumph for me if i could run him to earth      where my master had failed       luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry  but now      at last it came to my aid  and the messenger of good fortune was      none other than mr  frankland  who was standing  grey whiskered      and red faced  outside the gate of his garden  which opened on to      the highroad along which i travelled        good day  dr  watson   cried he with unwonted good humour   you      must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass      of wine and to congratulate me        my feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after      what i had heard of his treatment of his daughter  but i was      anxious to send perkins and the wagonette home  and the      opportunity was a good one  i alighted and sent a message to sir      henry that i should walk over in time for dinner  then i followed      frankland into his dining room        it is a great day for me  sir one of the red letter days of my      life   he cried with many chuckles   i have brought off a double      event  i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law  and      that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it  i have      established a right of way through the centre of old middleton s      park  slap across it  sir  within a hundred yards of his own      front door  what do you think of that  we ll teach these magnates      that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners       confound them  and i ve closed the wood where the fernworthy folk      used to picnic  these infernal people seem to think that there      are no rights of property  and that they can swarm where they      like with their papers and their bottles  both cases decided  dr       watson  and both in my favour  i haven t had such a day since i      had sir john morland for trespass because he shot in his own      warren         how on earth did you do that         look it up in the books  sir  it will repay reading frankland       v   morland  court of queen s bench  it cost me       but i got      my verdict         did it do you any good         none  sir  none  i am proud to say that i had no interest in the      matter  i act entirely from a sense of public duty  i have no      doubt  for example  that the fernworthy people will burn me in      effigy tonight  i told the police last time they did it that they      should stop these disgraceful exhibitions  the county      constabulary is in a scandalous state  sir  and it has not      afforded me the protection to which i am entitled  the case of      frankland  v   regina will bring the matter before the attention      of the public  i told them that they would have occasion to      regret their treatment of me  and already my words have come      true         how so   i asked       the old man put on a very knowing expression   because i could      tell them what they are dying to know  but nothing would induce      me to help the rascals in any way        i had been casting round for some excuse by which i could get      away from his gossip  but now i began to wish to hear more of it       i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to      understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest      way to stop his confidences        some poaching case  no doubt   said i with an indifferent      manner        ha  ha  my boy  a very much more important matter than that       what about the convict on the moor        i stared   you don t mean that you know where he is   said i        i may not know exactly where he is  but i am quite sure that i      could help the police to lay their hands on him  has it never      struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where      he got his food and so trace it to him        he certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth        no doubt   said i   but how do you know that he is anywhere upon      the moor         i know it because i have seen with my own eyes the messenger who      takes him his food        my heart sank for barrymore  it was a serious thing to be in the      power of this spiteful old busybody  but his next remark took a      weight from my mind        you ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a      child  i see him every day through my telescope upon the roof  he      passes along the same path at the same hour  and to whom should      he be going except to the convict        here was luck indeed  and yet i suppressed all appearance of      interest  a child  barrymore had said that our unknown was      supplied by a boy  it was on his track  and not upon the      convict s  that frankland had stumbled  if i could get his      knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt  but incredulity      and indifference were evidently my strongest cards        i should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of      one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father s dinner        the least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old      autocrat  his eyes looked malignantly at me  and his grey      whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat        indeed  sir   said he  pointing out over the wide stretching      moor   do you see that black tor over yonder  well  do you see      the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it  it is the      stoniest part of the whole moor  is that a place where a shepherd      would be likely to take his station  your suggestion  sir  is a      most absurd one        i meekly answered that i had spoken without knowing all the      facts  my submission pleased him and led him to further      confidences        you may be sure  sir  that i have very good grounds before i      come to an opinion  i have seen the boy again and again with his      bundle  every day  and sometimes twice a day  i have been      able but wait a moment  dr  watson  do my eyes deceive me  or is      there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside        it was several miles off  but i could distinctly see a small dark      dot against the dull green and grey        come  sir  come   cried frankland  rushing upstairs   you will      see with your own eyes and judge for yourself        the telescope  a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod       stood upon the flat leads of the house  frankland clapped his eye      to it and gave a cry of satisfaction        quick  dr  watson  quick  before he passes over the hill        there he was  sure enough  a small urchin with a little bundle      upon his shoulder  toiling slowly up the hill  when he reached      the crest i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant      against the cold blue sky  he looked round him with a furtive and      stealthy air  as one who dreads pursuit  then he vanished over      the hill        well  am i right         certainly  there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand         and what the errand is even a county constable could guess  but      not one word shall they have from me  and i bind you to secrecy      also  dr  watson  not a word  you understand         just as you wish         they have treated me shamefully shamefully  when the facts come      out in frankland  v   regina i venture to think that a thrill of      indignation will run through the country  nothing would induce me      to help the police in any way  for all they cared it might have      been me  instead of my effigy  which these rascals burned at the      stake  surely you are not going  you will help me to empty the      decanter in honour of this great occasion        but i resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading      him from his announced intention of walking home with me  i kept      the road as long as his eye was on me  and then i struck off      across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy      had disappeared  everything was working in my favour  and i swore      that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that      i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way       the sun was already sinking when i reached the summit of the      hill  and the long slopes beneath me were all golden green on one      side and grey shadow on the other  a haze lay low upon the      farthest sky line  out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of      belliver and vixen tor  over the wide expanse there was no sound      and no movement  one great grey bird  a gull or curlew  soared      aloft in the blue heaven  he and i seemed to be the only living      things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath      it  the barren scene  the sense of loneliness  and the mystery      and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart  the boy      was nowhere to be seen  but down beneath me in a cleft of the      hills there was a circle of the old stone huts  and in the middle      of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a      screen against the weather  my heart leaped within me as i saw      it  this must be the burrow where the stranger lurked  at last my      foot was on the threshold of his hiding place his secret was      within my grasp       as i approached the hut  walking as warily as stapleton would do      when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly  i      satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a      habitation  a vague pathway among the boulders led to the      dilapidated opening which served as a door  all was silent      within  the unknown might be lurking there  or he might be      prowling on the moor  my nerves tingled with the sense of      adventure  throwing aside my cigarette  i closed my hand upon the      butt of my revolver and  walking swiftly up to the door  i looked      in  the place was empty       but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false      scent  this was certainly where the man lived  some blankets      rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which      neolithic man had once slumbered  the ashes of a fire were heaped      in a rude grate  beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket      half full of water  a litter of empty tins showed that the place      had been occupied for some time  and i saw  as my eyes became      accustomed to the checkered light  a pannikin and a half full      bottle of spirits standing in the corner  in the middle of the      hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table  and upon this      stood a small cloth bundle the same  no doubt  which i had seen      through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy  it contained      a loaf of bread  a tinned tongue  and two tins of preserved      peaches  as i set it down again  after having examined it  my      heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper      with writing upon it  i raised it  and this was what i read       roughly scrawled in pencil   dr  watson has gone to coombe      tracey        for a minute i stood there with the paper in my hands thinking      out the meaning of this curt message  it was i  then  and not sir      henry  who was being dogged by this secret man  he had not      followed me himself  but he had set an agent the boy       perhaps upon my track  and this was his report  possibly i had      taken no step since i had been upon the moor which had not been      observed and reported  always there was this feeling of an unseen      force  a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and      delicacy  holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme      moment that one realised that one was indeed entangled in its      meshes       if there was one report there might be others  so i looked round      the hut in search of them  there was no trace  however  of      anything of the kind  nor could i discover any sign which might      indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this      singular place  save that he must be of spartan habits and cared      little for the comforts of life  when i thought of the heavy      rains and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and      immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that      inhospitable abode  was he our malignant enemy  or was he by      chance our guardian angel  i swore that i would not leave the hut      until i knew       outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with      scarlet and gold  its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches      by the distant pools which lay amid the great grimpen mire  there      were the two towers of baskerville hall  and there a distant blur      of smoke which marked the village of grimpen  between the two       behind the hill  was the house of the stapletons  all was sweet      and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light  and yet as i      looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of nature but      quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which      every instant was bringing nearer  with tingling nerves but a      fixed purpose  i sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited      with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant       and then at last i heard him  far away came the sharp clink of a      boot striking upon a stone  then another and yet another  coming      nearer and nearer  i shrank back into the darkest corner and      cocked the pistol in my pocket  determined not to discover myself      until i had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger       there was a long pause which showed that he had stopped  then      once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the      opening of the hut        it is a lovely evening  my dear watson   said a well known      voice   i really think that you will be more comfortable outside      than in  ',\n",
       " 'fixing the nets      sir henry was more pleased than surprised to see sherlock holmes       for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would      bring him down from london  he did raise his eyebrows  however       when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any      explanations for its absence  between us we soon supplied his      wants  and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet      as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should      know  but first i had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to      barrymore and his wife  to him it may have been an unmitigated      relief  but she wept bitterly in her apron  to all the world he      was the man of violence  half animal and half demon  but to her      he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood  the      child who had clung to her hand  evil indeed is the man who has      not one woman to mourn him        i ve been moping in the house all day since watson went off in      the morning   said the baronet   i guess i should have some      credit  for i have kept my promise  if i hadn t sworn not to go      about alone i might have had a more lively evening  for i had a      message from stapleton asking me over there         i have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening        said holmes drily   by the way  i don t suppose you appreciate      that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck        sir henry opened his eyes   how was that         this poor wretch was dressed in your clothes  i fear your      servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the      police         that is unlikely  there was no mark on any of them  as far as i      know         that s lucky for him in fact  it s lucky for all of you  since      you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter  i am not      sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to      arrest the whole household  watson s reports are most      incriminating documents         but how about the case   asked the baronet   have you made      anything out of the tangle  i don t know that watson and i are      much the wiser since we came down         i think that i shall be in a position to make the situation      rather more clear to you before long  it has been an exceedingly      difficult and most complicated business  there are several points      upon which we still want light but it is coming all the same         we ve had one experience  as watson has no doubt told you  we      heard the hound on the moor  so i can swear that it is not all      empty superstition  i had something to do with dogs when i was      out west  and i know one when i hear one  if you can muzzle that      one and put him on a chain i ll be ready to swear you are the      greatest detective of all time         i think i will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will      give me your help         whatever you tell me to do i will do         very good  and i will ask you also to do it blindly  without      always asking the reason         just as you like         if you will do this i think the chances are that our little      problem will soon be solved  i have no doubt        he stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the      air  the lamp beat upon his face  and so intent was it and so      still that it might have been that of a clear cut classical      statue  a personification of alertness and expectation        what is it   we both cried       i could see as he looked down that he was repressing some      internal emotion  his features were still composed  but his eyes      shone with amused exultation        excuse the admiration of a connoisseur   said he as he waved his      hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite      wall   watson won t allow that i know anything of art but that is      mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ  now       these are a really very fine series of portraits         well  i m glad to hear you say so   said sir henry  glancing      with some surprise at my friend   i don t pretend to know much      about these things  and i d be a better judge of a horse or a      steer than of a picture  i didn t know that you found time for      such things         i know what is good when i see it  and i see it now  that s a      kneller  i ll swear  that lady in the blue silk over yonder  and      the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a reynolds  they are      all family portraits  i presume         every one         do you know the names         barrymore has been coaching me in them  and i think i can say my      lessons fairly well         who is the gentleman with the telescope         that is rear admiral baskerville  who served under rodney in the      west indies  the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is      sir william baskerville  who was chairman of committees of the      house of commons under pitt         and this cavalier opposite to me the one with the black velvet      and the lace         ah  you have a right to know about him  that is the cause of all      the mischief  the wicked hugo  who started the hound of the      baskervilles  we re not likely to forget him        i gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait        dear me   said holmes   he seems a quiet  meek mannered man      enough  but i dare say that there was a lurking devil in his      eyes  i had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person         there s no doubt about the authenticity  for the name and the      date        are on the back of the canvas        holmes said little more  but the picture of the old roysterer      seemed to have a fascination for him  and his eyes were      continually fixed upon it during supper  it was not until later       when sir henry had gone to his room  that i was able to follow      the trend of his thoughts  he led me back into the      banqueting hall  his bedroom candle in his hand  and he held it      up against the time stained portrait on the wall        do you see anything there        i looked at the broad plumed hat  the curling love locks  the      white lace collar  and the straight  severe face which was framed      between them  it was not a brutal countenance  but it was prim       hard  and stern  with a firm set  thin lipped mouth  and a coldly      intolerant eye        is it like anyone you know         there is something of sir henry about the jaw         just a suggestion  perhaps  but wait an instant   he stood upon      a chair  and  holding up the light in his left hand  he curved      his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets        good heavens   i cried in amazement       the face of stapleton had sprung out of the canvas        ha  you see it now  my eyes have been trained to examine faces      and not their trimmings  it is the first quality of a criminal      investigator that he should see through a disguise         but this is marvellous  it might be his portrait         yes  it is an interesting instance of a throwback  which appears      to be both physical and spiritual  a study of family portraits is      enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation  the      fellow is a baskerville that is evident         with designs upon the succession         exactly  this chance of the picture has supplied us with one of      our most obvious missing links  we have him  watson  we have him       and i dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering      in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies  a pin  a      cork  and a card  and we add him to the baker street collection        he burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away      from the picture  i have not heard him laugh often  and it has      always boded ill to somebody       i was up betimes in the morning  but holmes was afoot earlier      still  for i saw him as i dressed  coming up the drive        yes  we should have a full day today   he remarked  and he      rubbed his hands with the joy of action   the nets are all in      place  and the drag is about to begin  we ll know before the day      is out whether we have caught our big  lean jawed pike  or      whether he has got through the meshes         have you been on the moor already         i have sent a report from grimpen to princetown as to the death      of selden  i think i can promise that none of you will be      troubled in the matter  and i have also communicated with my      faithful cartwright  who would certainly have pined away at the      door of my hut  as a dog does at his master s grave  if i had not      set his mind at rest about my safety         what is the next move         to see sir henry  ah  here he is         good morning  holmes   said the baronet   you look like a      general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff         that is the exact situation  watson was asking for orders         and so do i         very good  you are engaged  as i understand  to dine with our      friends the stapletons tonight         i hope that you will come also  they are very hospitable people       and i am sure that they would be very glad to see you         i fear that watson and i must go to london         to london         yes  i think that we should be more useful there at the present      juncture        the baronet s face perceptibly lengthened        i hoped that you were going to see me through this business  the      hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is      alone         my dear fellow  you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what      i tell you  you can tell your friends that we should have been      happy to have come with you  but that urgent business required us      to be in town  we hope very soon to return to devonshire  will      you remember to give them that message         if you insist upon it         there is no alternative  i assure you        i saw by the baronet s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by      what he regarded as our desertion        when do you desire to go   he asked coldly        immediately after breakfast  we will drive in to coombe tracey       but watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come      back to you  watson  you will send a note to stapleton to tell      him that you regret that you cannot come         i have a good mind to go to london with you   said the baronet        why should i stay here alone         because it is your post of duty  because you gave me your word      that you would do as you were told  and i tell you to stay         all right  then  i ll stay         one more direction  i wish you to drive to merripit house  send      back your trap  however  and let them know that you intend to      walk home         to walk across the moor         yes         but that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me      not to do         this time you may do it with safety  if i had not every      confidence in your nerve and courage i would not suggest it  but      it is essential that you should do it         then i will do it         and as you value your life do not go across the moor in any      direction save along the straight path which leads from merripit      house to the grimpen road  and is your natural way home         i will do just what you say         very good  i should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast      as possible  so as to reach london in the afternoon        i was much astounded by this programme  though i remembered that      holmes had said to stapleton on the night before that his visit      would terminate next day  it had not crossed my mind however       that he would wish me to go with him  nor could i understand how      we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to      be critical  there was nothing for it  however  but implicit      obedience  so we bade good bye to our rueful friend  and a couple      of hours afterwards we were at the station of coombe tracey and      had dispatched the trap upon its return journey  a small boy was      waiting upon the platform        any orders  sir         you will take this train to town  cartwright  the moment you      arrive you will send a wire to sir henry baskerville  in my name       to say that if he finds the pocketbook which i have dropped he is      to send it by registered post to baker street         yes  sir         and ask at the station office if there is a message for me        the boy returned with a telegram  which holmes handed to me  it      ran       wire received  coming down with unsigned warrant  arrive      five forty  lestrade        that is in answer to mine of this morning  he is the best of the      professionals  i think  and we may need his assistance  now       watson  i think that we cannot employ our time better than by      calling upon your acquaintance  mrs  laura lyons        his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident  he would use      the baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were      really gone  while we should actually return at the instant when      we were likely to be needed  that telegram from london  if      mentioned by sir henry to the stapletons  must remove the last      suspicions from their minds  already i seemed to see our nets      drawing closer around that lean jawed pike       mrs  laura lyons was in her office  and sherlock holmes opened      his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably      amazed her        i am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of      the late sir charles baskerville   said he   my friend here  dr       watson  has informed me of what you have communicated  and also      of what you have withheld in connection with that matter         what have i withheld   she asked defiantly        you have confessed that you asked sir charles to be at the gate      at ten o clock  we know that that was the place and hour of his      death  you have withheld what the connection is between these      events         there is no connection         in that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary      one  but i think that we shall succeed in establishing a      connection  after all  i wish to be perfectly frank with you       mrs  lyons  we regard this case as one of murder  and the      evidence may implicate not only your friend mr  stapleton but his      wife as well        the lady sprang from her chair        his wife   she cried        the fact is no longer a secret  the person who has passed for      his sister is really his wife        mrs  lyons had resumed her seat  her hands were grasping the arms      of her chair  and i saw that the pink nails had turned white with      the pressure of her grip        his wife   she said again   his wife  he is not a married man        sherlock holmes shrugged his shoulders        prove it to me  prove it to me  and if you can do so         the fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words        i have come prepared to do so   said holmes  drawing several      papers from his pocket   here is a photograph of the couple taken      in york four years ago  it is indorsed  mr  and mrs  vandeleur        but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him  and her also       if you know her by sight  here are three written descriptions by      trustworthy witnesses of mr  and mrs  vandeleur  who at that time      kept st  oliver s private school  read them and see if you can      doubt the identity of these people        she glanced at them  and then looked up at us with the set  rigid      face of a desperate woman        mr  holmes   she said   this man had offered me marriage on      condition that i could get a divorce from my husband  he has lied      to me  the villain  in every conceivable way  not one word of      truth has he ever told me  and why why  i imagined that all was      for my own sake  but now i see that i was never anything but a      tool in his hands  why should i preserve faith with him who never      kept any with me  why should i try to shield him from the      consequences of his own wicked acts  ask me what you like  and      there is nothing which i shall hold back  one thing i swear to      you  and that is that when i wrote the letter i never dreamed of      any harm to the old gentleman  who had been my kindest friend         i entirely believe you  madam   said sherlock holmes   the      recital of these events must be very painful to you  and perhaps      it will make it easier if i tell you what occurred  and you can      check me if i make any material mistake  the sending of this      letter was suggested to you by stapleton         he dictated it         i presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive      help from sir charles for the legal expenses connected with your      divorce         exactly         and then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from      keeping the appointment         he told me that it would hurt his self respect that any other      man should find the money for such an object  and that though he      was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing      the obstacles which divided us         he appears to be a very consistent character  and then you heard      nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper         no         and he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with      sir charles         he did  he said that the death was a very mysterious one  and      that i should certainly be suspected if the facts came out  he      frightened me into remaining silent         quite so  but you had your suspicions        she hesitated and looked down        i knew him   she said   but if he had kept faith with me i      should always have done so with him         i think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape   said      sherlock holmes   you have had him in your power and he knew it       and yet you are alive  you have been walking for some months very      near to the edge of a precipice  we must wish you good morning      now  mrs  lyons  and it is probable that you will very shortly      hear from us again         our case becomes rounded off  and difficulty after difficulty      thins away in front of us   said holmes as we stood waiting for      the arrival of the express from town   i shall soon be in the      position of being able to put into a single connected narrative      one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times       students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in      godno  in little russia  in the year      and of course there are      the anderson murders in north carolina  but this case possesses      some features which are entirely its own  even now we have no      clear case against this very wily man  but i shall be very much      surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this      night        the london express came roaring into the station  and a small       wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first class carriage  we      all three shook hands  and i saw at once from the reverential way      in which lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a      good deal since the days when they had first worked together  i      could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner      used then to excite in the practical man        anything good   he asked        the biggest thing for years   said holmes   we have two hours      before we need think of starting  i think we might employ it in      getting some dinner and then  lestrade  we will take the london      fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night      air of dartmoor  never been there  ah  well  i don t suppose you      will forget your first visit  ',\n",
       " 'the hound of the baskervilles      one of sherlock holmes s defects if  indeed  one may call it a      defect was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full      plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment       partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature  which      loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him  partly      also from his professional caution  which urged him never to take      any chances  the result  however  was very trying for those who      were acting as his agents and assistants  i had often suffered      under it  but never more so than during that long drive in the      darkness  the great ordeal was in front of us  at last we were      about to make our final effort  and yet holmes had said nothing       and i could only surmise what his course of action would be  my      nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon      our faces and the dark  void spaces on either side of the narrow      road told me that we were back upon the moor once again  every      stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us      nearer to our supreme adventure       our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of      the hired wagonette  so that we were forced to talk of trivial      matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation       it was a relief to me  after that unnatural restraint  when we at      last passed frankland s house and knew that we were drawing near      to the hall and to the scene of action  we did not drive up to      the door but got down near the gate of the avenue  the wagonette      was paid off and ordered to return to coombe tracey forthwith       while we started to walk to merripit house        are you armed  lestrade        the little detective smiled   as long as i have my trousers i      have a hip pocket  and as long as i have my hip pocket i have      something in it         good  my friend and i are also ready for emergencies         you re mighty close about this affair  mr  holmes  what s the      game now         a waiting game         my word  it does not seem a very cheerful place   said the      detective with a shiver  glancing round him at the gloomy slopes      of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the      grimpen mire   i see the lights of a house ahead of us         that is merripit house and the end of our journey  i must      request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper        we moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the      house  but holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards      from it        this will do   said he   these rocks upon the right make an      admirable screen         we are to wait here         yes  we shall make our little ambush here  get into this hollow       lestrade  you have been inside the house  have you not  watson       can you tell the position of the rooms  what are those latticed      windows at this end         i think they are the kitchen windows         and the one beyond  which shines so brightly         that is certainly the dining room         the blinds are up  you know the lie of the land best  creep      forward quietly and see what they are doing but for heaven s sake      don t let them know that they are watched        i tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which      surrounded the stunted orchard  creeping in its shadow i reached      a point whence i could look straight through the uncurtained      window       there were only two men in the room  sir henry and stapleton       they sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the      round table  both of them were smoking cigars  and coffee and      wine were in front of them  stapleton was talking with animation       but the baronet looked pale and distrait  perhaps the thought of      that lonely walk across the ill omened moor was weighing heavily      upon his mind       as i watched them stapleton rose and left the room  while sir      henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair       puffing at his cigar  i heard the creak of a door and the crisp      sound of boots upon gravel  the steps passed along the path on      the other side of the wall under which i crouched  looking over       i saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out house in the      corner of the orchard  a key turned in a lock  and as he passed      in there was a curious scuffling noise from within  he was only a      minute or so inside  and then i heard the key turn once more and      he passed me and reentered the house  i saw him rejoin his guest       and i crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to      tell them what i had seen        you say  watson  that the lady is not there   holmes asked when      i had finished my report        no         where can she be  then  since there is no light in any other      room except the kitchen         i cannot think where she is        i have said that over the great grimpen mire there hung a dense       white fog  it was drifting slowly in our direction and banked      itself up like a wall on that side of us  low but thick and well      defined  the moon shone on it  and it looked like a great      shimmering ice field  with the heads of the distant tors as rocks      borne upon its surface  holmes s face was turned towards it  and      he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift        it s moving towards us  watson         is that serious         very serious  indeed the one thing upon earth which could have      disarranged my plans  he can t be very long  now  it is already      ten o clock  our success and even his life may depend upon his      coming out before the fog is over the path        the night was clear and fine above us  the stars shone cold and      bright  while a half moon bathed the whole scene in a soft       uncertain light  before us lay the dark bulk of the house  its      serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the      silver spangled sky  broad bars of golden light from the lower      windows stretched across the orchard and the moor  one of them      was suddenly shut off  the servants had left the kitchen  there      only remained the lamp in the dining room where the two men  the      murderous host and the unconscious guest  still chatted over      their cigars       every minute that white woolly plain which covered one half of      the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house  already the      first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of      the lighted window  the farther wall of the orchard was already      invisible  and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white      vapour  as we watched it the fog wreaths came crawling round both      corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on      which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship      upon a shadowy sea  holmes struck his hand passionately upon the      rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience        if he isn t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be      covered  in half an hour we won t be able to see our hands in      front of us         shall we move farther back upon higher ground         yes  i think it would be as well        so as the fog bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we      were half a mile from the house  and still that dense white sea       with the moon silvering its upper edge  swept slowly and      inexorably on        we are going too far   said holmes   we dare not take the chance      of his being overtaken before he can reach us  at all costs we      must hold our ground where we are   he dropped on his knees and      clapped his ear to the ground   thank god  i think that i hear      him coming        a sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor  crouching      among the stones we stared intently at the silver tipped bank in      front of us  the steps grew louder  and through the fog  as      through a curtain  there stepped the man whom we were awaiting       he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear       starlit night  then he came swiftly along the path  passed close      to where we lay  and went on up the long slope behind us  as he      walked he glanced continually over either shoulder  like a man      who is ill at ease        hist   cried holmes  and i heard the sharp click of a cocking      pistol   look out  it s coming        there was a thin  crisp  continuous patter from somewhere in the      heart of that crawling bank  the cloud was within fifty yards of      where we lay  and we glared at it  all three  uncertain what      horror was about to break from the heart of it  i was at holmes s      elbow  and i glanced for an instant at his face  it was pale and      exultant  his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight  but      suddenly they started forward in a rigid  fixed stare  and his      lips parted in amazement  at the same instant lestrade gave a      yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground  i      sprang to my feet  my inert hand grasping my pistol  my mind      paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from      the shadows of the fog  a hound it was  an enormous coal black      hound  but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen  fire      burst from its open mouth  its eyes glowed with a smouldering      glare  its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in      flickering flame  never in the delirious dream of a disordered      brain could anything more savage  more appalling  more hellish be      conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us      out of the wall of fog       with long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the      track  following hard upon the footsteps of our friend  so      paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass      before we had recovered our nerve  then holmes and i both fired      together  and the creature gave a hideous howl  which showed that      one at least had hit him  he did not pause  however  but bounded      onward  far away on the path we saw sir henry looking back  his      face white in the moonlight  his hands raised in horror  glaring      helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down  but      that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the      winds  if he was vulnerable he was mortal  and if we could wound      him we could kill him  never have i seen a man run as holmes ran      that night  i am reckoned fleet of foot  but he outpaced me as      much as i outpaced the little professional  in front of us as we      flew up the track we heard scream after scream from sir henry and      the deep roar of the hound  i was in time to see the beast spring      upon its victim  hurl him to the ground  and worry at his throat       but the next instant holmes had emptied five barrels of his      revolver into the creature s flank  with a last howl of agony and      a vicious snap in the air  it rolled upon its back  four feet      pawing furiously  and then fell limp upon its side  i stooped       panting  and pressed my pistol to the dreadful  shimmering head       but it was useless to press the trigger  the giant hound was      dead       sir henry lay insensible where he had fallen  we tore away his      collar  and holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw      that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in      time  already our friend s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble      effort to move  lestrade thrust his brandy flask between the      baronet s teeth  and two frightened eyes were looking up at us        my god   he whispered   what was it  what  in heaven s name  was      it         it s dead  whatever it is   said holmes   we ve laid the family      ghost once and forever        in mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was      lying stretched before us  it was not a pure bloodhound and it      was not a pure mastiff  but it appeared to be a combination of      the two gaunt  savage  and as large as a small lioness  even now      in the stillness of death  the huge jaws seemed to be dripping      with a bluish flame and the small  deep set  cruel eyes were      ringed with fire  i placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle  and      as i held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the      darkness        phosphorus   i said        a cunning preparation of it   said holmes  sniffing at the dead      animal   there is no smell which might have interfered with his      power of scent  we owe you a deep apology  sir henry  for having      exposed you to this fright  i was prepared for a hound  but not      for such a creature as this  and the fog gave us little time to      receive him         you have saved my life         having first endangered it  are you strong enough to stand         give me another mouthful of that brandy and i shall be ready for      anything  so  now  if you will help me up  what do you propose to      do         to leave you here  you are not fit for further adventures      tonight  if you will wait  one or other of us will go back with      you to the hall        he tried to stagger to his feet  but he was still ghastly pale      and trembling in every limb  we helped him to a rock  where he      sat shivering with his face buried in his hands        we must leave you now   said holmes   the rest of our work must      be done  and every moment is of importance  we have our case  and      now we only want our man        it s a thousand to one against our finding him at the house   he      continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path   those      shots must have told him that the game was up         we were some distance off  and this fog may have deadened them         he followed the hound to call him off of that you may be      certain  no  no  he s gone by this time  but we ll search the      house and make sure        the front door was open  so we rushed in and hurried from room to      room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant  who met us      in the passage  there was no light save in the dining room  but      holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house      unexplored  no sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing       on the upper floor  however  one of the bedroom doors was locked        there s someone in here   cried lestrade   i can hear a      movement  open this door        a faint moaning and rustling came from within  holmes struck the      door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew      open  pistol in hand  we all three rushed into the room       but there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant      villain whom we expected to see  instead we were faced by an      object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment      staring at it in amazement       the room had been fashioned into a small museum  and the walls      were lined by a number of glass topped cases full of that      collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had      been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man  in the      centre of this room there was an upright beam  which had been      placed at some period as a support for the old worm eaten baulk      of timber which spanned the roof  to this post a figure was tied       so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to      secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was      that of a man or a woman  one towel passed round the throat and      was secured at the back of the pillar  another covered the lower      part of the face  and over it two dark eyes eyes full of grief      and shame and a dreadful questioning stared back at us  in a      minute we had torn off the gag  unswathed the bonds  and mrs       stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us  as her beautiful      head fell upon her chest i saw the clear red weal of a whiplash      across her neck        the brute   cried holmes   here  lestrade  your brandy bottle       put her in the chair  she has fainted from ill usage and      exhaustion        she opened her eyes again        is he safe   she asked   has he escaped         he cannot escape us  madam         no  no  i did not mean my husband  sir henry  is he safe         yes         and the hound         it is dead        she gave a long sigh of satisfaction        thank god  thank god  oh  this villain  see how he has treated      me   she shot her arms out from her sleeves  and we saw with      horror that they were all mottled with bruises   but this is      nothing nothing  it is my mind and soul that he has tortured and      defiled  i could endure it all  ill usage  solitude  a life of      deception  everything  as long as i could still cling to the hope      that i had his love  but now i know that in this also i have been      his dupe and his tool   she broke into passionate sobbing as she      spoke        you bear him no good will  madam   said holmes   tell us then      where we shall find him  if you have ever aided him in evil  help      us now and so atone         there is but one place where he can have fled   she answered        there is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire       it was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made      preparations so that he might have a refuge  that is where he      would fly        the fog bank lay like white wool against the window  holmes held      the lamp towards it        see   said he   no one could find his way into the grimpen mire      tonight        she laughed and clapped her hands  her eyes and teeth gleamed      with fierce merriment        he may find his way in  but never out   she cried   how can he      see the guiding wands tonight  we planted them together  he and      i  to mark the pathway through the mire  oh  if i could only have      plucked them out today  then indeed you would have had him at      your mercy        it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog      had lifted  meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house      while holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville      hall  the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld      from him  but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth      about the woman whom he had loved  but the shock of the night s      adventures had shattered his nerves  and before morning he lay      delirious in a high fever under the care of dr  mortimer  the two      of them were destined to travel together round the world before      sir henry had become once more the hale  hearty man that he had      been before he became master of that ill omened estate       and now i come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular      narrative  in which i have tried to make the reader share those      dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and      ended in so tragic a manner  on the morning after the death of      the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by mrs  stapleton      to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog  it      helped us to realise the horror of this woman s life when we saw      the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband s      track  we left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm       peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog  from the      end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the      path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those      green scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the      stranger  rank reeds and lush  slimy water plants sent an odour      of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces  while a      false step plunged us more than once thigh deep into the dark       quivering mire  which shook for yards in soft undulations around      our feet  its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked       and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was      tugging us down into those obscene depths  so grim and purposeful      was the clutch in which it held us  once only we saw a trace that      someone had passed that perilous way before us  from amid a tuft      of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing      was projecting  holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the      path to seize it  and had we not been there to drag him out he      could never have set his foot upon firm land again  he held an      old black boot in the air   meyers  toronto   was printed on the      leather inside        it is worth a mud bath   said he   it is our friend sir henry s      missing boot         thrown there by stapleton in his flight         exactly  he retained it in his hand after using it to set the      hound upon the track  he fled when he knew the game was up  still      clutching it  and he hurled it away at this point of his flight       we know at least that he came so far in safety        but more than that we were never destined to know  though there      was much which we might surmise  there was no chance of finding      footsteps in the mire  for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon      them  but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass      we all looked eagerly for them  but no slightest sign of them      ever met our eyes  if the earth told a true story  then stapleton      never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled      through the fog upon that last night  somewhere in the heart of      the great grimpen mire  down in the foul slime of the huge morass      which had sucked him in  this cold and cruel hearted man is      forever buried       many traces we found of him in the bog girt island where he had      hid his savage ally  a huge driving wheel and a shaft half filled      with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine  beside it      were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners  driven      away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp  in one      of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones      showed where the animal had been confined  a skeleton with a      tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the  d bris         a dog   said holmes   by jove  a curly haired spaniel  poor      mortimer will never see his pet again  well  i do not know that      this place contains any secret which we have not already      fathomed  he could hide his hound  but he could not hush its      voice  and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not      pleasant to hear  on an emergency he could keep the hound in the      out house at merripit  but it was always a risk  and it was only      on the supreme day  which he regarded as the end of all his      efforts  that he dared do it  this paste in the tin is no doubt      the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed  it was      suggested  of course  by the story of the family hell hound  and      by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death  no wonder the      poor devil of a convict ran and screamed  even as our friend did       and as we ourselves might have done  when he saw such a creature      bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track  it was      a cunning device  for  apart from the chance of driving your      victim to his death  what peasant would venture to inquire too      closely into such a creature should he get sight of it  as many      have done  upon the moor  i said it in london  watson  and i say      it again now  that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more      dangerous man than he who is lying yonder  he swept his long arm      towards the huge mottled expanse of green splotched bog which      stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the      moor ',\n",
       " 'a retrospection      it was the end of november  and holmes and i sat  upon a raw and      foggy night  on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting room      in baker street  since the tragic upshot of our visit to      devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost      importance  in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious      conduct of colonel upwood in connection with the famous card      scandal of the nonpareil club  while in the second he had      defended the unfortunate mme  montpensier from the charge of      murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her      step daughter  mlle  car re  the young lady who  as it will be      remembered  was found six months later alive and married in new      york  my friend was in excellent spirits over the success which      had attended a succession of difficult and important cases  so      that i was able to induce him to discuss the details of the      baskerville mystery  i had waited patiently for the opportunity      for i was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap  and      that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its      present work to dwell upon memories of the past  sir henry and      dr  mortimer were  however  in london  on their way to that long      voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his      shattered nerves  they had called upon us that very afternoon  so      that it was natural that the subject should come up for      discussion        the whole course of events   said holmes   from the point of      view of the man who called himself stapleton was simple and      direct  although to us  who had no means in the beginning of      knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of      the facts  it all appeared exceedingly complex  i have had the      advantage of two conversations with mrs  stapleton  and the case      has now been so entirely cleared up that i am not aware that      there is anything which has remained a secret to us  you will      find a few notes upon the matter under the heading b in my      indexed list of cases         perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of      events from memory         certainly  though i cannot guarantee that i carry all the facts      in my mind  intense mental concentration has a curious way of      blotting out what has passed  the barrister who has his case at      his fingers  ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his      own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it      all out of his head once more  so each of my cases displaces the      last  and mlle  car re has blurred my recollection of baskerville      hall  tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my      notice which will in turn dispossess the fair french lady and the      infamous upwood  so far as the case of the hound goes  however  i      will give you the course of events as nearly as i can  and you      will suggest anything which i may have forgotten        my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait      did not lie  and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville  he      was a son of that rodger baskerville  the younger brother of sir      charles  who fled with a sinister reputation to south america       where he was said to have died unmarried  he did  as a matter of      fact  marry  and had one child  this fellow  whose real name is      the same as his father s  he married beryl garcia  one of the      beauties of costa rica  and  having purloined a considerable sum      of public money  he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to      england  where he established a school in the east of yorkshire       his reason for attempting this special line of business was that      he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon      the voyage home  and that he had used this man s ability to make      the undertaking a success  fraser  the tutor  died however  and      the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy       the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to      stapleton  and he brought the remains of his fortune  his schemes      for the future  and his taste for entomology to the south of      england  i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized      authority upon the subject  and that the name of vandeleur has      been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had  in his      yorkshire days  been the first to describe        we now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be      of such intense interest to us  the fellow had evidently made      inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and      a valuable estate  when he went to devonshire his plans were  i      believe  exceedingly hazy  but that he meant mischief from the      first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him      in the character of his sister  the idea of using her as a decoy      was clearly already in his mind  though he may not have been      certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged  he meant      in the end to have the estate  and he was ready to use any tool      or run any risk for that end  his first act was to establish      himself as near to his ancestral home as he could  and his second      was to cultivate a friendship with sir charles baskerville and      with the neighbours        the baronet himself told him about the family hound  and so      prepared the way for his own death  stapleton  as i will continue      to call him  knew that the old man s heart was weak and that a      shock would kill him  so much he had learned from dr  mortimer       he had heard also that sir charles was superstitious and had      taken this grim legend very seriously  his ingenious mind      instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to      death  and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the      guilt to the real murderer        having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with      considerable finesse  an ordinary schemer would have been content      to work with a savage hound  the use of artificial means to make      the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part  the      dog he bought in london from ross and mangles  the dealers in      fulham road  it was the strongest and most savage in their      possession  he brought it down by the north devon line and walked      a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without      exciting any remarks  he had already on his insect hunts learned      to penetrate the grimpen mire  and so had found a safe      hiding place for the creature  here he kennelled it and waited      his chance        but it was some time coming  the old gentleman could not be      decoyed outside of his grounds at night  several times stapleton      lurked about with his hound  but without avail  it was during      these fruitless quests that he  or rather his ally  was seen by      peasants  and that the legend of the demon dog received a new      confirmation  he had hoped that his wife might lure sir charles      to his ruin  but here she proved unexpectedly independent  she      would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a      sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy       threats and even  i am sorry to say  blows refused to move her       she would have nothing to do with it  and for a time stapleton      was at a deadlock        he found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that      sir charles  who had conceived a friendship for him  made him the      minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman       mrs  laura lyons  by representing himself as a single man he      acquired complete influence over her  and he gave her to      understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her      husband he would marry her  his plans were suddenly brought to a      head by his knowledge that sir charles was about to leave the      hall on the advice of dr  mortimer  with whose opinion he himself      pretended to coincide  he must act at once  or his victim might      get beyond his power  he therefore put pressure upon mrs  lyons      to write this letter  imploring the old man to give her an      interview on the evening before his departure for london  he      then  by a specious argument  prevented her from going  and so      had the chance for which he had waited        driving back in the evening from coombe tracey he was in time to      get his hound  to treat it with his infernal paint  and to bring      the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that      he would find the old gentleman waiting  the dog  incited by its      master  sprang over the wicket gate and pursued the unfortunate      baronet  who fled screaming down the yew alley  in that gloomy      tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge      black creature  with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes  bounding      after its victim  he fell dead at the end of the alley from heart      disease and terror  the hound had kept upon the grassy border      while the baronet had run down the path  so that no track but the      man s was visible  on seeing him lying still the creature had      probably approached to sniff at him  but finding him dead had      turned away again  it was then that it left the print which was      actually observed by dr  mortimer  the hound was called off and      hurried away to its lair in the grimpen mire  and a mystery was      left which puzzled the authorities  alarmed the countryside  and      finally brought the case within the scope of our observation        so much for the death of sir charles baskerville  you perceive      the devilish cunning of it  for really it would be almost      impossible to make a case against the real murderer  his only      accomplice was one who could never give him away  and the      grotesque  inconceivable nature of the device only served to make      it more effective  both of the women concerned in the case  mrs       stapleton and mrs  laura lyons  were left with a strong suspicion      against stapleton  mrs  stapleton knew that he had designs upon      the old man  and also of the existence of the hound  mrs  lyons      knew neither of these things  but had been impressed by the death      occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was      only known to him  however  both of them were under his      influence  and he had nothing to fear from them  the first half      of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult      still remained        it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of      an heir in canada  in any case he would very soon learn it from      his friend dr  mortimer  and he was told by the latter all      details about the arrival of henry baskerville  stapleton s first      idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be      done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all       he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in      laying a trap for the old man  and he dared not leave her long      out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her       it was for this reason that he took her to london with him  they      lodged  i find  at the mexborough private hotel  in craven      street  which was actually one of those called upon by my agent      in search of evidence  here he kept his wife imprisoned in her      room while he  disguised in a beard  followed dr  mortimer to      baker street and afterwards to the station and to the      northumberland hotel  his wife had some inkling of his plans  but      she had such a fear of her husband a fear founded upon brutal      ill treatment that she dare not write to warn the man whom she      knew to be in danger  if the letter should fall into stapleton s      hands her own life would not be safe  eventually  as we know  she      adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form      the message  and addressing the letter in a disguised hand  it      reached the baronet  and gave him the first warning of his      danger        it was very essential for stapleton to get some article of sir      henry s attire so that  in case he was driven to use the dog  he      might always have the means of setting him upon his track  with      characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once       and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber maid of the hotel      was well bribed to help him in his design  by chance  however       the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and       therefore  useless for his purpose  he then had it returned and      obtained another a most instructive incident  since it proved      conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound       as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an      old boot and this indifference to a new one  the more  outr   and      grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be      examined  and the very point which appears to complicate a case      is  when duly considered and scientifically handled  the one      which is most likely to elucidate it        then we had the visit from our friends next morning  shadowed      always by stapleton in the cab  from his knowledge of our rooms      and of my appearance  as well as from his general conduct  i am      inclined to think that stapleton s career of crime has been by no      means limited to this single baskerville affair  it is suggestive      that during the last three years there have been four      considerable burglaries in the west country  for none of which      was any criminal ever arrested  the last of these  at folkestone      court  in may  was remarkable for the cold blooded pistolling of      the page  who surprised the masked and solitary burglar  i cannot      doubt that stapleton recruited his waning resources in this      fashion  and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous      man        we had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when      he got away from us so successfully  and also of his audacity in      sending back my own name to me through the cabman  from that      moment he understood that i had taken over the case in london       and that therefore there was no chance for him there  he returned      to dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet         one moment   said i   you have  no doubt  described the sequence      of events correctly  but there is one point which you have left      unexplained  what became of the hound when its master was in      london         i have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly      of importance  there can be no question that stapleton had a      confidant  though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in      his power by sharing all his plans with him  there was an old      manservant at merripit house  whose name was anthony  his      connection with the stapletons can be traced for several years       as far back as the school mastering days  so that he must have      been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and      wife  this man has disappeared and has escaped from the country       it is suggestive that anthony is not a common name in england       while antonio is so in all spanish or spanish american countries       the man  like mrs  stapleton herself  spoke good english  but      with a curious lisping accent  i have myself seen this old man      cross the grimpen mire by the path which stapleton had marked      out  it is very probable  therefore  that in the absence of his      master it was he who cared for the hound  though he may never      have known the purpose for which the beast was used        the stapletons then went down to devonshire  whither they were      soon followed by sir henry and you  one word now as to how i      stood myself at that time  it may possibly recur to your memory      that when i examined the paper upon which the printed words were      fastened i made a close inspection for the water mark  in doing      so i held it within a few inches of my eyes  and was conscious of      a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine  there are      seventy five perfumes  which it is very necessary that a criminal      expert should be able to distinguish from each other  and cases      have more than once within my own experience depended upon their      prompt recognition  the scent suggested the presence of a lady       and already my thoughts began to turn towards the stapletons       thus i had made certain of the hound  and had guessed at the      criminal before ever we went to the west country        it was my game to watch stapleton  it was evident  however  that      i could not do this if i were with you  since he would be keenly      on his guard  i deceived everybody  therefore  yourself included       and i came down secretly when i was supposed to be in london  my      hardships were not so great as you imagined  though such trifling      details must never interfere with the investigation of a case  i      stayed for the most part at coombe tracey  and only used the hut      upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of      action  cartwright had come down with me  and in his disguise as      a country boy he was of great assistance to me  i was dependent      upon him for food and clean linen  when i was watching stapleton       cartwright was frequently watching you  so that i was able to      keep my hand upon all the strings        i have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly       being forwarded instantly from baker street to coombe tracey       they were of great service to me  and especially that one      incidentally truthful piece of biography of stapleton s  i was      able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew      at last exactly how i stood  the case had been considerably      complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the      relations between him and the barrymores  this also you cleared      up in a very effective way  though i had already come to the same      conclusions from my own observations        by the time that you discovered me upon the moor i had a      complete knowledge of the whole business  but i had not a case      which could go to a jury  even stapleton s attempt upon sir henry      that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict      did not help us much in proving murder against our man  there      seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red handed  and to      do so we had to use sir henry  alone and apparently unprotected       as a bait  we did so  and at the cost of a severe shock to our      client we succeeded in completing our case and driving stapleton      to his destruction  that sir henry should have been exposed to      this is  i must confess  a reproach to my management of the case       but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing      spectacle which the beast presented  nor could we predict the fog      which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice  we      succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and      dr  mortimer assure me will be a temporary one  a long journey      may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered      nerves but also from his wounded feelings  his love for the lady      was deep and sincere  and to him the saddest part of all this      black business was that he should have been deceived by her        it only remains to indicate the part which she had played      throughout  there can be no doubt that stapleton exercised an      influence over her which may have been love or may have been      fear  or very possibly both  since they are by no means      incompatible emotions  it was  at least  absolutely effective  at      his command she consented to pass as his sister  though he found      the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her      the direct accessory to murder  she was ready to warn sir henry      so far as she could without implicating her husband  and again      and again she tried to do so  stapleton himself seems to have      been capable of jealousy  and when he saw the baronet paying      court to the lady  even though it was part of his own plan  still      he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which      revealed the fiery soul which his self contained manner so      cleverly concealed  by encouraging the intimacy he made it      certain that sir henry would frequently come to merripit house      and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he      desired  on the day of the crisis  however  his wife turned      suddenly against him  she had learned something of the death of      the convict  and she knew that the hound was being kept in the      outhouse on the evening that sir henry was coming to dinner  she      taxed her husband with his intended crime  and a furious scene      followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a      rival in his love  her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter      hatred  and he saw that she would betray him  he tied her up       therefore  that she might have no chance of warning sir henry       and he hoped  no doubt  that when the whole countryside put down      the baronet s death to the curse of his family  as they certainly      would do  he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished      fact and to keep silent upon what she knew  in this i fancy that      in any case he made a miscalculation  and that  if we had not      been there  his doom would none the less have been sealed  a      woman of spanish blood does not condone such an injury so      lightly  and now  my dear watson  without referring to my notes       i cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case  i      do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained         he could not hope to frighten sir henry to death as he had done      the old uncle with his bogie hound         the beast was savage and half starved  if its appearance did not      frighten its victim to death  at least it would paralyze the      resistance which might be offered         no doubt  there only remains one difficulty  if stapleton came      into the succession  how could he explain the fact that he  the      heir  had been living unannounced under another name so close to      the property  how could he claim it without causing suspicion and      inquiry         it is a formidable difficulty  and i fear that you ask too much      when you expect me to solve it  the past and the present are      within the field of my inquiry  but what a man may do in the      future is a hard question to answer  mrs  stapleton has heard her      husband discuss the problem on several occasions  there were      three possible courses  he might claim the property from south      america  establish his identity before the british authorities      there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to england at      all  or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short      time that he need be in london  or  again  he might furnish an      accomplice with the proofs and papers  putting him in as heir       and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income  we      cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found      some way out of the difficulty  and now  my dear watson  we have      had some weeks of severe work  and for one evening  i think  we      may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels  i have a box      for  les huguenots   have you heard the de reszkes  might i      trouble you then to be ready in half an hour  and we can stop at      marcini s for a little dinner on the way  the end',\n",
       " 'death on the moor      for a moment or two i sat breathless  hardly able to believe my      ears  then my senses and my voice came back to me  while a      crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be      lifted from my soul  that cold  incisive  ironical voice could      belong to but one man in all the world        holmes   i cried  holmes         come out   said he   and please be careful with the revolver        i stooped under the rude lintel  and there he sat upon a stone      outside  his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon      my astonished features  he was thin and worn  but clear and      alert  his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the      wind  in his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other      tourist upon the moor  and he had contrived  with that catlike      love of personal cleanliness which was one of his      characteristics  that his chin should be as smooth and his linen      as perfect as if he were in baker street        i never was more glad to see anyone in my life   said i as i      wrung him by the hand        or more astonished  eh         well  i must confess to it         the surprise was not all on one side  i assure you  i had no      idea that you had found my occasional retreat  still less that      you were inside it  until i was within twenty paces of the door         my footprint  i presume         no  watson  i fear that i could not undertake to recognize your      footprint amid all the footprints of the world  if you seriously      desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist  for when i      see the stub of a cigarette marked bradley  oxford street  i know      that my friend watson is in the neighbourhood  you will see it      there beside the path  you threw it down  no doubt  at that      supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut         exactly         i thought as much and knowing your admirable tenacity i was      convinced that you were sitting in ambush  a weapon within reach       waiting for the tenant to return  so you actually thought that i      was the criminal         i did not know who you were  but i was determined to find out         excellent  watson  and how did you localise me  you saw me       perhaps  on the night of the convict hunt  when i was so      imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me         yes  i saw you then         and have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this      one         no  your boy had been observed  and that gave me a guide where      to look         the old gentleman with the telescope  no doubt  i could not make      it out when first i saw the light flashing upon the lens   he      rose and peeped into the hut   ha  i see that cartwright has      brought up some supplies  what s this paper  so you have been to      coombe tracey  have you         yes         to see mrs  laura lyons         exactly         well done  our researches have evidently been running on      parallel lines  and when we unite our results i expect we shall      have a fairly full knowledge of the case         well  i am glad from my heart that you are here  for indeed the      responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my      nerves  but how in the name of wonder did you come here  and what      have you been doing  i thought that you were in baker street      working out that case of blackmailing         that was what i wished you to think         then you use me  and yet do not trust me   i cried with some      bitterness   i think that i have deserved better at your hands       holmes         my dear fellow  you have been invaluable to me in this as in      many other cases  and i beg that you will forgive me if i have      seemed to play a trick upon you  in truth  it was partly for your      own sake that i did it  and it was my appreciation of the danger      which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter      for myself  had i been with sir henry and you it is confident      that my point of view would have been the same as yours  and my      presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on      their guard  as it is  i have been able to get about as i could      not possibly have done had i been living in the hall  and i      remain an unknown factor in the business  ready to throw in all      my weight at a critical moment         but why keep me in the dark         for you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have      led to my discovery  you would have wished to tell me something       or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or      other  and so an unnecessary risk would be run  i brought      cartwright down with me you remember the little chap at the      express office and he has seen after my simple wants  a loaf of      bread and a clean collar  what does man want more  he has given      me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet  and      both have been invaluable         then my reports have all been wasted   my voice trembled as i      recalled the pains and the pride with which i had composed them       holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket        here are your reports  my dear fellow  and very well thumbed  i      assure you  i made excellent arrangements  and they are only      delayed one day upon their way  i must compliment you exceedingly      upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an      extraordinarily difficult case        i was still rather raw over the deception which had been      practised upon me  but the warmth of holmes s praise drove my      anger from my mind  i felt also in my heart that he was right in      what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that i      should not have known that he was upon the moor        that s better   said he  seeing the shadow rise from my face        and now tell me the result of your visit to mrs  laura lyons it      was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you      had gone  for i am already aware that she is the one person in      coombe tracey who might be of service to us in the matter  in      fact  if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that i      should have gone tomorrow        the sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor  the air had      turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth  there       sitting together in the twilight  i told holmes of my      conversation with the lady  so interested was he that i had to      repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied        this is most important   said he when i had concluded   it fills      up a gap which i had been unable to bridge in this most complex      affair  you are aware  perhaps  that a close intimacy exists      between this lady and the man stapleton         i did not know of a close intimacy         there can be no doubt about the matter  they meet  they write       there is a complete understanding between them  now  this puts a      very powerful weapon into our hands  if i could only use it to      detach his wife         his wife         i am giving you some information now  in return for all that you      have given me  the lady who has passed here as miss stapleton is      in reality his wife         good heavens  holmes  are you sure of what you say  how could he      have permitted sir henry to fall in love with her         sir henry s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except      sir henry  he took particular care that sir henry did not make      love to her  as you have yourself observed  i repeat that the      lady is his wife and not his sister         but why this elaborate deception         because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to      him in the character of a free woman        all my unspoken instincts  my vague suspicions  suddenly took      shape and centred upon the naturalist  in that impassive      colourless man  with his straw hat and his butterfly net  i      seemed to see something terrible a creature of infinite patience      and craft  with a smiling face and a murderous heart        it is he  then  who is our enemy it is he who dogged us in      london         so i read the riddle         and the warning it must have come from her         exactly        the shape of some monstrous villainy  half seen  half guessed       loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long        but are you sure of this  holmes  how do you know that the woman      is his wife         because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of      autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you  and i dare      say he has many a time regretted it since  he was once a      schoolmaster in the north of england  now  there is no one more      easy to trace than a schoolmaster  there are scholastic agencies      by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession       a little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief      under atrocious circumstances  and that the man who had owned      it the name was different had disappeared with his wife  the      descriptions agreed  when i learned that the missing man was      devoted to entomology the identification was complete        the darkness was rising  but much was still hidden by the      shadows        if this woman is in truth his wife  where does mrs  laura lyons      come in   i asked        that is one of the points upon which your own researches have      shed a light  your interview with the lady has cleared the      situation very much  i did not know about a projected divorce      between herself and her husband  in that case  regarding      stapleton as an unmarried man  she counted no doubt upon becoming      his wife         and when she is undeceived         why  then we may find the lady of service  it must be our first      duty to see her both of us tomorrow  don t you think  watson       that you are away from your charge rather long  your place should      be at baskerville hall        the last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had      settled upon the moor  a few faint stars were gleaming in a      violet sky        one last question  holmes   i said as i rose   surely there is      no need of secrecy between you and me  what is the meaning of it      all  what is he after        holmes s voice sank as he answered        it is murder  watson refined  cold blooded  deliberate murder       do not ask me for particulars  my nets are closing upon him  even      as his are upon sir henry  and with your help he is already      almost at my mercy  there is but one danger which can threaten      us  it is that he should strike before we are ready to do so       another day two at the most and i have my case complete  but      until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother      watched her ailing child  your mission today has justified      itself  and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his      side  hark        a terrible scream a prolonged yell of horror and anguish burst      out of the silence of the moor  that frightful cry turned the      blood to ice in my veins        oh  my god   i gasped   what is it  what does it mean        holmes had sprung to his feet  and i saw his dark  athletic      outline at the door of the hut  his shoulders stooping  his head      thrust forward  his face peering into the darkness        hush   he whispered   hush        the cry had been loud on account of its vehemence  but it had      pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain  now it      burst upon our ears  nearer  louder  more urgent than before        where is it   holmes whispered  and i knew from the thrill of      his voice that he  the man of iron  was shaken to the soul        where is it  watson         there  i think   i pointed into the darkness        no  there        again the agonised cry swept through the silent night  louder and      much nearer than ever  and a new sound mingled with it  a deep       muttered rumble  musical and yet menacing  rising and falling      like the low  constant murmur of the sea        the hound   cried holmes   come  watson  come  great heavens  if      we are too late        he had started running swiftly over the moor  and i had followed      at his heels  but now from somewhere among the broken ground      immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell       and then a dull  heavy thud  we halted and listened  not another      sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night       i saw holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted       he stamped his feet upon the ground        he has beaten us  watson  we are too late         no  no  surely not         fool that i was to hold my hand  and you  watson  see what comes      of abandoning your charge  but  by heaven  if the worst has      happened we ll avenge him        blindly we ran through the gloom  blundering against boulders       forcing our way through gorse bushes  panting up hills and      rushing down slopes  heading always in the direction whence those      dreadful sounds had come  at every rise holmes looked eagerly      round him  but the shadows were thick upon the moor  and nothing      moved upon its dreary face        can you see anything         nothing         but  hark  what is that        a low moan had fallen upon our ears  there it was again upon our      left  on that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which      overlooked a stone strewn slope  on its jagged face was      spread eagled some dark  irregular object  as we ran towards it      the vague outline hardened into a definite shape  it was a      prostrate man face downward upon the ground  the head doubled      under him at a horrible angle  the shoulders rounded and the body      hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault  so      grotesque was the attitude that i could not for the instant      realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul  not a      whisper  not a rustle  rose now from the dark figure over which      we stooped  holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again      with an exclamation of horror  the gleam of the match which he      struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool      which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim  and it      shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint      within us the body of sir henry baskerville       there was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar      ruddy tweed suit the very one which he had worn on the first      morning that we had seen him in baker street  we caught the one      clear glimpse of it  and then the match flickered and went out       even as the hope had gone out of our souls  holmes groaned  and      his face glimmered white through the darkness        the brute  the brute   i cried with clenched hands   oh holmes       i shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate         i am more to blame than you  watson  in order to have my case      well rounded and complete  i have thrown away the life of my      client  it is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my      career  but how could i know how  could  i know that he would      risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my      warnings         that we should have heard his screams my god  those screams  and      yet have been unable to save him  where is this brute of a hound      which drove him to his death  it may be lurking among these rocks      at this instant  and stapleton  where is he  he shall answer for      this deed         he shall  i will see to that  uncle and nephew have been      murdered the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast      which he thought to be supernatural  the other driven to his end      in his wild flight to escape from it  but now we have to prove      the connection between the man and the beast  save from what we      heard  we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter  since      sir henry has evidently died from the fall  but  by heavens       cunning as he is  the fellow shall be in my power before another      day is past        we stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body       overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had      brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end  then      as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which      our poor friend had fallen  and from the summit we gazed out over      the shadowy moor  half silver and half gloom  far away  miles      off  in the direction of grimpen  a single steady yellow light      was shining  it could only come from the lonely abode of the      stapletons  with a bitter curse i shook my fist at it as i gazed        why should we not seize him at once         our case is not complete  the fellow is wary and cunning to the      last degree  it is not what we know  but what we can prove  if we      make one false move the villain may escape us yet         what can we do         there will be plenty for us to do tomorrow  tonight we can only      perform the last offices to our poor friend        together we made our way down the precipitous slope and      approached the body  black and clear against the silvered stones       the agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain      and blurred my eyes with tears        we must send for help  holmes  we cannot carry him all the way      to the hall  good heavens  are you mad        he had uttered a cry and bent over the body  now he was dancing      and laughing and wringing my hand  could this be my stern       self contained friend  these were hidden fires  indeed        a beard  a beard  the man has a beard         a beard         it is not the baronet it is why  it is my neighbour  the      convict        with feverish haste we had turned the body over  and that      dripping beard was pointing up to the cold  clear moon  there      could be no doubt about the beetling forehead  the sunken animal      eyes  it was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the      light of the candle from over the rock the face of selden  the      criminal       then in an instant it was all clear to me  i remembered how the      baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to      barrymore  barrymore had passed it on in order to help selden in      his escape  boots  shirt  cap it was all sir henry s  the tragedy      was still black enough  but this man had at least deserved death      by the laws of his country  i told holmes how the matter stood       my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy        then the clothes have been the poor devil s death   said he   it      is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article      of sir henry s the boot which was abstracted in the hotel  in all      probability and so ran this man down  there is one very singular      thing  however  how came selden  in the darkness  to know that      the hound was on his trail         he heard him         to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like      this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk      recapture by screaming wildly for help  by his cries he must have      run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track  how did      he know         a greater mystery to me is why this hound  presuming that all      our conjectures are correct         i presume nothing         well  then  why this hound should be loose tonight  i suppose      that it does not always run loose upon the moor  stapleton would      not let it go unless he had reason to think that sir henry would      be there         my difficulty is the more formidable of the two  for i think      that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours  while      mine may remain forever a mystery  the question now is  what      shall we do with this poor wretch s body  we cannot leave it here      to the foxes and the ravens         i suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can      communicate with the police         exactly  i have no doubt that you and i could carry it so far       halloa  watson  what s this  it s the man himself  by all that s      wonderful and audacious  not a word to show your suspicions not a      word  or my plans crumble to the ground        a figure was approaching us over the moor  and i saw the dull red      glow of a cigar  the moon shone upon him  and i could distinguish      the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist  he stopped      when he saw us  and then came on again        why  dr  watson  that s not you  is it  you are the last man      that i should have expected to see out on the moor at this time      of night  but  dear me  what s this  somebody hurt  not don t      tell me that it is our friend sir henry   he hurried past me and      stooped over the dead man  i heard a sharp intake of his breath      and the cigar fell from his fingers        who who s this   he stammered        it is selden  the man who escaped from princetown        stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us  but by a supreme effort      he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment  he looked      sharply from holmes to me   dear me  what a very shocking affair       how did he die         he appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks       my friend and i were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry         i heard a cry also  that was what brought me out  i was uneasy      about sir henry         why about sir henry in particular   i could not help asking        because i had suggested that he should come over  when he did      not come i was surprised  and i naturally became alarmed for his      safety when i heard cries upon the moor  by the way  his eyes      darted again from my face to holmes s  did you hear anything else      besides a cry         no   said holmes   did you         no         what do you mean  then         oh  you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom      hound  and so on  it is said to be heard at night upon the moor       i was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound      tonight         we heard nothing of the kind   said i        and what is your theory of this poor fellow s death         i have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off      his head  he has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and      eventually fallen over here and broken his neck         that seems the most reasonable theory   said stapleton  and he      gave a sigh which i took to indicate his relief   what do you      think about it  mr  sherlock holmes        my friend bowed his compliments   you are quick at      identification   said he        we have been expecting you in these parts since dr  watson came      down  you are in time to see a tragedy         yes  indeed  i have no doubt that my friend s explanation will      cover the facts  i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to      london with me tomorrow         oh  you return tomorrow         that is my intention         i hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences      which have puzzled us        holmes shrugged his shoulders        one cannot always have the success for which one hopes  an      investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours  it has not      been a satisfactory case        my friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner       stapleton still looked hard at him  then he turned to me        i would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house  but it      would give my sister such a fright that i do not feel justified      in doing it  i think that if we put something over his face he      will be safe until morning        and so it was arranged  resisting stapleton s offer of      hospitality  holmes and i set off to baskerville hall  leaving      the naturalist to return alone  looking back we saw the figure      moving slowly away over the broad moor  and behind him that one      black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was      lying who had come so horribly to his end        we re at close grips at last   said holmes as we walked together      across the moor   what a nerve the fellow has  how he pulled      himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing      shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his      plot  i told you in london  watson  and i tell you now again       that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel         i am sorry that he has seen you         and so was i at first  but there was no getting out of it         what effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he      knows you are here         it may cause him to be more cautious  or it may drive him to      desperate measures at once  like most clever criminals  he may be      too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has      completely deceived us         why should we not arrest him at once         my dear watson  you were born to be a man of action  your      instinct is always to do something energetic  but supposing  for      argument s sake  that we had him arrested tonight  what on earth      the better off should we be for that  we could prove nothing      against him  there s the devilish cunning of it  if he were      acting through a human agent we could get some evidence  but if      we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not      help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master         surely we have a case         not a shadow of one only surmise and conjecture  we should be      laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such      evidence         there is sir charles s death         found dead without a mark upon him  you and i know that he died      of sheer fright  and we know also what frightened him  but how      are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it  what signs are      there of a hound  where are the marks of its fangs  of course we      know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that sir charles      was dead before ever the brute overtook him  but we have to prove      all this  and we are not in a position to do it         well  then  tonight         we are not much better off tonight  again  there was no direct      connection between the hound and the man s death  we never saw      the hound  we heard it  but we could not prove that it was      running upon this man s trail  there is a complete absence of      motive  no  my dear fellow  we must reconcile ourselves to the      fact that we have no case at present  and that it is worth our      while to run any risk in order to establish one         and how do you propose to do so         i have great hopes of what mrs  laura lyons may do for us when      the position of affairs is made clear to her  and i have my own      plan as well  sufficient for

baskerville gates        are you coming up         yes  i see no reason for further concealment  but one last word       watson  say nothing of the hound to sir henry  let him think that      selden s death was as stapleton would have us believe  he will      have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo      tomorrow  when he is engaged  if i remember your report aright       to dine with these people         and so am i         then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone  that will be      easily arranged  and now  if we are too late for dinner  i think      that we are both ready for our suppers  ']"
